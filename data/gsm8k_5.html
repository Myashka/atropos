<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Let's carefully analyze what is given and what needs to be found.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells.</li>
<li>
<p>Since 1 dozen = 12, 2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24 shells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So Kyle's shells = 2 × Mimi's shells = 2 × 24 = 48 shells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of Kyle's shells.</p>
</li>
<li>Leigh's shells = (1/3) × Kyle's shells = (1/3) × 48.</li>
</ol>
<p>Calculate this:<br />
(1/3) × 48 = 48 ÷ 3 = 16.</p>
<p>Thus, Leigh had 16 seashells.</p>

<ol>
<li>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells.</li>
<li>Since 1 dozen = 12, then 2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24.</li>

</li>
<li>Leigh's shells = (1/3) × Kyle's shells = (1/3) × 48 = 16.</li>

<p>The question asks: How many seashells did Leigh have?</p>
<p>The calculation shows Leigh has 16 shells.</p>

<p>Kyle's shells = 2 \times 24 = 48.</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. Therefore:</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for the different pets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let C = number of cats</li>
<li>Let S = number of snakes</li>
<li>Let P = number of parrots</li>
<li>He has D = number of dogs</li>
</ul>
<p>From the problem, we know:</p>
<ol>
<li>S = C + 6 (Frankie has six more snakes than cats)</li>
<li>P = C - 1 (He has one less parrot than cats)</li>
<li>D = 2 (He has 2 dogs)</li>
</ol>
<p>The total number of pets = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Substitute S and P in terms of C:</p>
<p>Total pets = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2</p>
<p>Combine like terms:</p>
<p>Total pets = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2</p>
<p>= (C + C + C) + (6 - 1 + 2)</p>
<p>= 3C + 7</p>
<p>Now, the critical piece of information is: Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Let's analyze which pets typically have four legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs</li>
</ul>
<p>From the problem, "Six of his pets have four legs" — this likely refers to a certain group of animals that altogether sum up to six animals with four legs.</p>
<p>Since we know the number of dogs (D = 2, with 4 legs each), that's 2 four-legged pets.</p>
<p>We need to account for the remaining four-legged pets to reach the total of 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: all have 4 legs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s check possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If cats = C, and all cats have four legs, then cats contribute C four-legged pets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dogs: D = 2 (both 4-legged).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total four-legged pets among cats and dogs: C + 2</p>
<p>We need this total to be 6:</p>
<p>C + 2 = 6</p>
<p>=&gt; C = 4</p>
<p>With C = 4,</p>
<p>Number of snakes: S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10</p>
<p>Number of parrots: P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3</p>
<p>Total pets:</p>
<p>C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p>Check the number of four-legged animals: cats (4), dogs (2), total four-legged animals:</p>
<p>Cats: 4</p>
<p>Dogs: 2</p>
<p>Total: 4 + 2 = 6</p>
<p>This matches the given: six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Therefore, total pets = 19.</p>

Let's define variables for the number of each type of pet:<br />
- C = number of cats<br />
- S = number of snakes<br />
- P = number of parrots<br />
- D = number of dogs</p>
<p>Given data:<br />
1. Frankie's pets consist of snakes, cats, parrots, and dogs.<br />
2. He has six more snakes than cats: ( S = C + 6 ).<br />
3. He has one less parrot than cats: ( P = C - 1 ).<br />
4. He has 2 dogs: ( D = 2 ).<br />
5. Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Now, to find the total number of pets, we need to determine ( C ), then sum all pets:<br />
[<br />
\text{Total} = C + S + P + D<br />
]</p>
<p>Next, consider the number of four-legged pets:<br />
- Cats: 4 legs each<br />
- Snakes: 0 legs<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs each<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each</p>
<p>Total legs from all pets:<br />
[<br />
\text{Total legs} = 4 \times C + 0 \times S + 2 \times P + 4 \times D<br />

<p>Plugging in known and expressed variables:<br />
[<br />
\text{Total legs} = 4C + 0 + 2(C - 1) + 4 \times 2<br />
]<br />
[<br />
= 4C + 2C - 2 + 8<br />
]<br />
[<br />
= 6C + 6<br />

<p>We know exactly 6 of his pets have four legs. The pets with four legs are cats, and dogs since snakes have no legs and parrots have 2 legs.</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:<br />
[<br />
C + D = 6<br />

because:<br />
- Cats (C): 4 legs each<br />
- Dogs (2): 4 legs each</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets:<br />
[<br />
C + D = C + 2<br />

(remember D=2).</p>
<p>Given that this total is 6:<br />
[<br />
C + 2 = 6<br />
]<br />
[<br />
C = 4<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, find the number of snakes and parrots:</p>
<p>[<br />
S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10<br />

[<br />
P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3<br />

<p>Total pets:<br />
[<br />
C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19<br />

- Snakes: (0)<br />
- Parrots: (2 \times 3 = 6)<br />
- Dogs: (4 \times 2 = 8)</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Let's define variables to represent the number of each type of pet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let ( C ) = number of cats</li>
<li>Let ( S ) = number of snakes</li>
<li>Let ( P ) = number of parrots</li>
<li>Let ( D ) = number of dogs</li>
</ul>
<p>From the problem, we have the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Frankie has six more snakes than cats: ( S = C + 6 )</li>
<li>He has one less parrot than cats: ( P = C - 1 )</li>
<li>He has 2 dogs: ( D = 2 )</li>
<li>Six of his pets have four legs</li>
<li>The total number of pets is the sum of all these animals</li>
</ol>
<p>First, identify how many pets he has:<br />
Total pets = ( C + S + P + D )</p>
<p>Rewrite total in terms of ( C ):</p>
<p>Total = ( C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 )</p>
<p>Calculate:</p>
<p>Total = ( C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2 = (C + C + C) + (6 - 1 + 2) = 3C + 7 )</p>
<p>So, total number of pets = ( 3C + 7 )</p>
<p>Now, determine how many pets have four legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs each</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs each</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each</li>
</ul>
<p>Total legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: ( 4 \times C )</li>
<li>Snakes: 0</li>
<li>Parrots: ( 2 \times P = 2 \times (C - 1) )</li>
<li>Dogs: ( 4 \times 2 = 8 )</li>
</ul>
<p>Total legs = ( 4C + 0 + 2(C - 1) + 8 )</p>
<p>Simplify:</p>
<p>Total legs = ( 4C + 2C - 2 + 8 = (4C + 2C) + ( -2 + 8) = 6C + 6 )</p>
<p>Number of pets with four legs:</p>
<p>We are told that six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Number of pets with four legs = 6</p>
<p>Expressed in terms of C:</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets = cats + dogs = ( C + 2 )</p>
<p>Set equal to 6:</p>
<p>( C + 2 = 6 )</p>
<p>Solve for ( C ):</p>
<p>( C = 6 - 2 = 4 )</p>
<p>Now, find all others:</p>
<p>( S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 )</p>
<p>( P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 )</p>
<p>Total pets = ( C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 )</p>
<p><strong>Answer: total pets = 19</strong></p>
<p><think>Everything checks out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of cats: 4</li>
<li>Snakes: 10</li>
<li>Parrots: 3</li>
<li>Dogs: 2</li>
<li>Total pets: 19</li>
<li>Pets with four legs: cats (4) + dogs (2) = 6, matching the problem statement</li>

<p>Total four-legged pets:<br />
[<br />
\text{Number of 4-legged pets} = C \text{ (cats)} + 2 \text{ (dogs)} = C + 2<br />

<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for each type of pet:<br />
- Let C = number of cats<br />
- Let S = number of snakes<br />
- Let P = number of parrots<br />
- Let D = number of dogs (given as 2)</p>
<p>From the problem:<br />
1. He has six more snakes than cats: S = C + 6<br />
2. He has one less parrot than cats: P = C - 1<br />
3. He has 2 dogs: D = 2</p>
<p>The total number of pets is:<br />
Total = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Substitute S and P:<br />
Total = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2</p>
<p>Combine like terms:<br />
Total = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2<br />
Total = (C + C + C) + (6 - 1 + 2)<br />
Total = 3C + 7</p>
<p>Next, the problem states that six of his pets have four legs. Typically:<br />
- Cats: 4 legs each<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each<br />
- Snakes: 0 legs<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs</p>
<p>So, total pets with 4 legs:<br />
Number of cats + number of dogs = C + 2</p>
<p>Given:<br />
C + 2 = 6 (since 6 pets have four legs)</p>
<p>Solve for C:<br />
C = 6 - 2 = 4</p>
<p>Now, substitute C back into the total:<br />
Total = 3 * 4 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19</p>
<p>Let's verify:<br />
- Cats = 4<br />
- Snakes = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10<br />
- Parrots = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3<br />
- Dogs = 2</p>
<p>Sum:<br />
4 (cats) + 10 (snakes) + 3 (parrots) + 2 (dogs) = 19 pets</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:<br />
Cats and dogs: 4 + 2 = 6, matches the given.</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for the different types of pets Frankie has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let ( C ) be the number of cats.</li>
<li>He has 6 more snakes than cats: ( S = C + 6 ).</li>
<li>He has one less parrot than cats: ( P = C - 1 ).</li>
</ul>
<p>We are told:<br />
- He has 2 dogs: ( D = 2 ).</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
[<br />
T = C + S + P + D + \text{(any other pets)}.<br />
]</p>
<p>But from the problem, it seems only cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs are mentioned. We'll assume these are all his pets, for a total of:</p>
<p>[<br />
T = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2.<br />
]</p>
<p>Simplify the total:<br />
[<br />
T = 3C + (6 - 1 + 2) = 3C + 7.<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, the problem states:<br />
"Six of his pets have four legs." Let's consider which pets have four legs:<br />
- Cats: 4 legs each, so ( C ) cats contribute ( 4C ).<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each, so 2 dogs contribute ( 2 \times 4 = 8 ).<br />
- Snakes and parrots do not have four legs.</p>
<p>Total pet legs:<br />
[<br />
\text{legs} = 4C + 8.<br />
]</p>
<p>We need to know how many of the total pets have four legs. The phrase "six of his pets have four legs" most naturally refers to the number of pets, not just the legs.</p>
<p>Thus, the number of four-legged pets is:<br />
[<br />
C \text{ (cats)} + 2 \text{ (dogs)} = C + 2.<br />
]</p>
<p>Given that six pets have four legs, we have:<br />
[<br />
C + 2 = 6 \implies C = 4.<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, find all other pet counts:<br />
- Snakes: ( S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 ).<br />
- Parrots: ( P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 ).<br />
- Dogs: 2 (given).  </p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
[<br />
T = C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19.<br />
]</p>
<p>Let’s verify the total number of four-legged pets:<br />
- Cats: 4<br />
- Dogs: 2<br />
Total four-legged: 4 + 2 = 6, matches the statement.</p>
<p>All pet counts:<br />
[<br />
C = 4, \quad S=10, \quad P=3, \quad D=2.<br />
]</p>
<p>Total pets = 19.</p>
<p><think><br />
Yes, everything matches logically: the number of pets with four legs is 6, as stated, and the totals for each animal type fit the constraints. Therefore, the total number of pets Frankie has is 19.</p>

<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for each type of pet:<br />
- Let ( C ) = number of cats<br />
- Let ( S ) = number of snakes<br />
- Let ( P ) = number of parrots<br />
- Let ( D ) = number of dogs</p>
<p>From the problem, we have the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He has six more snakes than cats:<br />
[ S = C + 6 ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has one less parrot than cats:<br />
[ P = C - 1 ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has 2 dogs:<br />
[ D = 2 ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's consider which pets have four legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs</li>
</ul>
<p>To find the total number of pets, we need the total counts for all pets: </p>
<p>[ \text{Total pets} = C + S + P + D ]</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:</p>
<ul>
<li>All cats: ( C )</li>
<li>All dogs: ( 2 )</li>
<li>All parrots: ( P ) (which have 2 legs, so they don't contribute to four-legged count)</li>
<li>All snakes: ( S ) (0 legs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total four-legged pets:</p>
<p>[ \text{Four-legged} = C + 2 ]</p>
<p>Given that six pets have four legs:</p>
<p>[ C + 2 = 6 ]</p>
<p>Solve for ( C ):</p>
<p>[ C = 6 - 2 = 4 ]</p>
<p>Now, find other values:</p>
<ul>
<li>( S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 )</li>
<li>( P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 )</li>
<li>( D = 2 ) (given)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets:</p>
<p>[ C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 ]</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong></p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4</li>
<li>Dogs: 2</li>
<li>Parrots: 3 (2 legs each, so they do not count towards four-legged)</li>
<li>Snakes: 10 (no legs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total four-legged:</p>
<p>[ 4 + 2 = 6 ] which matches the given.</p>
<p>So, the total number of pets is 19.</p>
<p><think> The values are consistent with all conditions, so I am confident in this solution.</think></p>
