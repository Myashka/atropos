<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells.  </li>
<li>
<p>Since 1 dozen = 12, then:<br />
   [<br />
   \text{Mimi's shells} = 2 \times 12 = 24<br />
   ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mimi has 24, so:<br />
   [<br />
   \text{Kyle's shells} = 2 \times 24 = 48<br />
   ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  </p>
</li>
<li>Kyle has 48 shells; therefore, Leigh took:<br />
   [<br />
   \frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16<br />
   ]</li>
</ol>
<p>So, Leigh has 16 seashells.</p>
<p>The question asks explicitly: How many seashells did Leigh have?<br />
Answer: 16</p>

<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Since 1 dozen is 12, Mimi has:<br />
   2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24 shells.</p>

Let's break down the problem carefully:</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for each type of pet:<br />
- Let ( c ) = number of cats<br />
- Let ( s ) = number of snakes<br />
- Let ( p ) = number of parrots<br />
- Let ( d ) = number of dogs</p>
<p>From the problem, we know:<br />
1. ( s = c + 6 ) (Frankie has six more snakes than cats)<br />
2. ( p = c - 1 ) (Frankie has one less parrot than cats)<br />
3. ( d = 2 ) (Frankie has 2 dogs)</p>
<p>Total pets = ( c + s + p + d )</p>
<p>We are told that six of his pets have four legs. Usually:<br />
- Cats have 4 legs: ( c )<br />
- Snakes have 0 legs: ( s )<br />
- Parrots have 2 legs each: ( p )<br />
- Dogs have 4 legs: ( d )</p>
<p>Total number of legs is not directly asked for, but noting that six pets have four legs helps us verify the counts, especially since only cats and dogs have four legs.</p>
<p>Let's determine possible counts of pets consistent with the "six pets have four legs" statement.</p>
<p>The pets with four legs are:<br />
- Cats: ( c )<br />
- Dogs: ( 2 ) (fixed)</p>
<p>So, total four-legged pets = ( c + 2 )</p>
<p>This total equals 6 (the number of pets with four legs), hence:<br />
[ c + 2 = 6 \implies c = 4 ]</p>
<p>Now, using ( c = 4 ), find other pets:<br />
- Snakes: ( s = c + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 )<br />
- Parrots: ( p = c - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 )</p>
<p>Number of pets:<br />
[ c + s + p + d = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 ]</p>
<p>Total pets = (\boxed{19})</p>
<p><think><br />
The key step was recognizing that the six pets with four legs are all cats and dogs, since snakes have no legs, and parrots have two. With six pets with four legs, and only cats and dogs having four legs, the number of cats must be ( c = 4 ). The other counts follow logically.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: (\boxed{19})</strong><br />

<p><think>Let's define the variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let ( C ) = number of cats</li>
<li>Let ( S ) = number of snakes</li>
<li>Let ( P ) = number of parrots</li>
<li>Let ( D ) = number of dogs (given as 2)</li>
<li>Total pets = ( C + S + P + D )</li>
</ul>
<p>Given facts:<br />
1. ( S = C + 6 ) (Frankie has six more snakes than cats)<br />
2. ( P = C - 1 ) (He has one less parrot than cats)<br />
3. Total pets are composed of six pets with four legs. Typically:<br />
   - Cats: 4 legs<br />
   - Dogs: 4 legs<br />
   - Parrots: 2 legs<br />
   - Snakes: 0 legs</p>
<p>Number of pets with four legs:<br />
[ \text{cats} + \text{dogs} = C + D ]<br />
Number with fewer legs (parrots):<br />
[ P = C - 1 ]</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets:<br />
[ C + D = 6 ]<br />
Plugging in ( D = 2 ):<br />
[ C + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[ C = 4 ]</p>
<p>Now:<br />
[ S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 ]<br />
[ P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 ]</p>
<p>Check total:<br />
[ \text{Total pets} = C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 ]</p>
<p>Verify:<br />
- Pets with four legs: cats (4) + dogs (2) = 6, matches given.<br />
- Parrots: 3 (less than cats by 1) matches.<br />
- Snakes: 10, six more than cats, matches.</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Let's define variables for the types of pets Frankie has.</p>
<p>Let:<br />
- C = number of cats<br />
- S = number of snakes<br />
- P = number of parrots<br />
- D = number of dogs</p>
<p>Given:<br />
- D = 2 (since he has 2 dogs)<br />
- S = C + 6 (since he has six more snakes than cats)<br />
- P = C - 1 (since he has one less parrot than cats)<br />
- Total pets with four legs = 6<br />
  - Typically, cats, dogs, and parrots have four legs.<br />
  - Snakes have zero legs.</p>
<p>We need to find total pets: T = C + S + P + D.</p>
<p>First, express S and P in terms of C:<br />
- S = C + 6<br />
- P = C - 1</p>
<p>The total number of four-legged pets:<br />
- Cats: C<br />
- Dogs: D = 2<br />
- Parrots: P = C - 1<br />
- Snakes: S = C + 6 (but snakes have zero legs)</p>
<p>Sum of four-legged pets:<br />
C (cats) + 2 (dogs) + (C - 1) (parrots) = 6</p>
<p>Since snakes have no legs, they don't count towards the four-legged total.</p>
<p>Set up the equation:<br />
C + 2 + (C - 1) = 6</p>
<p>Simplify:<br />
C + 2 + C - 1 = 6<br />
2C + 1 = 6</p>
<p>Solve for C:<br />
2C = 5<br />
C = 5/2 = 2.5</p>
<p>But the number of pets must be an integer. Is there a mistake? Check assumptions.</p>
<p>Wait: The problem states that "Six of his pets have four legs."</p>
<p>Is that the total number of pets with four legs? Or is it that among his pets, six have four legs? Reading carefully, "Six of his pets have four legs." That suggests the total number of four-legged pets is six.</p>
<p>Our calculation with variables indicates that total number of cats + dogs + parrots = 6.</p>
<p>Are snakes included? No, because they have zero legs.</p>
<p>So, the sum of cats, parrots, and dogs is six.</p>
<p>Plugging in:<br />
C (cats) + P (parrots) + D (dogs) = 6</p>
<p>But D is known:<br />
D=2</p>
<p>And P = C - 1</p>
<p>So:<br />
C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6</p>
<p>Simplify:<br />
C + C - 1 + 2 = 6<br />
2C + 1 = 6</p>
<p>2C = 5<br />
C = 2.5</p>
<p>Again, fractional, which doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Is there a misinterpretation? Could the pets with four legs be only cats, dogs, and parrots, and their total be six? Or perhaps the total number of all pets is more?</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps the total number of pets with four legs is six, consistent with what the problem states, but the total may include or exclude snakes.</p>
<p>Given the constraints, perhaps the only way to get whole integer values is to reconsider the equation.</p>
<p>Suppose:<br />
Sum of pets with four legs = 6</p>
<p>Number of cats = C</p>
<p>Number of dogs = 2</p>
<p>Number of parrots = P = C - 1</p>
<p>Snakes = S = C + 6, but snakes have zero legs.</p>
<p>Sum of the four-legged pets:</p>
<p>C (cats) + P (parrots) + D (dogs) = 6</p>
<p>Plugging P and D:</p>
<p>C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6</p>
<p>Combine:<br />
2C + 1 = 6<br />
2C = 5<br />
C = 2.5</p>
<p>Does this mean there's a misstatement? Perhaps the total of six pets with four legs includes snakes? But snakes have zero legs.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the "six of his pets have four legs" refers solely to cats, dogs, and parrots.</p>
<p>Now, note that the fractional solution indicates that the numbers may be fractional unless the conditions are set to fit integer values.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps I've made an error assuming that the total of pets with four legs is the sum of cats, parrots, and dogs.</p>
<p>Now, what if the total number of pets with four legs is total pets minus snakes' number? But that's redundant.</p>
<p>Is there any other possible interpretation? The key information is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>6 pets have four legs (which probably includes cats, parrots, and dogs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has 2 dogs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has six more snakes than cats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has one less parrot than cats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's restate:</p>
<p>Number of pets with four legs is six, and the only animals with four legs are cats, parrots, and dogs (assuming serpents have zero).</p>
<p>Number of dogs: 2.</p>
<p>Number of parrots: P = C - 1.</p>
<p>Number of cats: C.</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets:</p>
<p>C + P + 2 = 6</p>
<p>Substitute P:</p>
<p>C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6</p>
<p>Simplify:</p>
<p>2C + 1 = 6</p>
<p>2C = 5</p>
<p>C = 2.5</p>
<p>Again, fractional.</p>
<p>Therefore, likely the problem is designed such that the total number of cats and parrots sum to an integer, but the data as posed leads to fractional. Alternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to assume fractional values as parts of a puzzle.</p>
<p>But more properly, perhaps the question expects the total number of pets, using the relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>S = C + 6</li>
<li>P = C - 1</li>
<li>D = 2</li>
<li>The number of pets with four legs is six.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets:</p>
<p>T = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Expressed in terms of C:</p>
<p>T = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 =?</p>
<p>Sum:</p>
<p>C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2 = 3C + 7</p>
<p>From earlier, the sum of cats, parrots, and dogs with four legs is 6:</p>
<p>C + P + D = 6 → C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6</p>
<p>→ 2C + 1 = 6</p>
<p>→ 2C = 5</p>
<p>→ C = 2.5</p>
<p>Even though C is fractional, the total:</p>
<p>T = 3C + 7 = 3 * 2.5 + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5</p>
<p>Total pets: 14.5, which is not practical (can't have fractional pets). Possibly, the problem expects the result based on integer counts, indicating that the numbers must fulfill the conditions with integer values.</p>
<p>Trying to find integer solutions:</p>
<p>Suppose C=2:</p>
<p>P = C -1 = 1</p>
<p>Total with four legs:</p>
<p>C + P + D = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 &lt; 6</p>
<p>So not enough.</p>
<p>Suppose C=3:</p>
<p>P=2</p>
<p>Sum: 3 + 2 + 2=7 &gt; 6; too high.</p>
<p>Suppose C=2.5 (not integer). So only C=2 or 3.</p>
<p>At C=2, total of pets with four legs is 5, less than six.</p>
<p>At C=3, total is 7, more than six.</p>
<p>We need exactly six.</p>
<p>C=2.25?</p>
<p>Not practical.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps the total number of pets with four legs is only based on cats and dogs, excluding parrots:</p>
<p>Cats (C), Dogs (2): sum = C + 2</p>
<p>Given total of 6:</p>
<p>C + 2 = 6 → C=4</p>
<p>Then, parrots P= C - 1 = 3</p>
<p>Check if total pets: C + S + P + D.</p>
<p>S= C + 6= 4 + 6=10</p>
<p>Total pets:</p>
<p>C=4</p>
<p>S=10</p>
<p>P=3</p>
<p>D=2</p>
<p>Total: 4 + 10 + 3 + 2=19</p>
<p>Total pets: 19</p>
<p>Check total number of four-legged pets:</p>
<p>Cats=4</p>
<p>D=2</p>
<p>Parrots=3</p>
<p>Sum: 4 + 2 + 3=9</p>
<p>But the original states that six pets have four legs.</p>
<p>This is inconsistent with this assumption.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps the "six of his pets have four legs" refers only to a subset.</p>
<p>Alternatively, suppose:</p>
<p>Total pets are:</p>
<p>Number of cats: C</p>
<p>Number of snakes: S = C + 6</p>
<p>Number of parrots: P = C - 1</p>
<p>Number of dogs: 2</p>
<p>Total pets: T=C+ S + P + D</p>
<p>= C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 = 3C + 7</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:</p>
<p>Cats: C</p>
<p>Dogs: 2</p>
<p>Parrots: P = C - 1</p>
<p>Sum: C + 2 + C - 1 = 2C + 1</p>
<p>Given that this sum is 6 (number of pets with four legs):</p>
<p>2C + 1=6</p>
<p>2C=5</p>
<p>C=2.5</p>
<p>Again fractional.</p>
<p>Given the recurring fractional solution, perhaps the intended answer considers the total sum with fractional parts.</p>
<p>Total pets:</p>
<p>T=3C + 7 = 3*2.5 + 7= 7.5 +7=14.5</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite fractional C, the total number of pets is 14.5.</p>
<p>But since pets can't be fractional, perhaps it's best to accept the fractional solution as the intended derived total.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the problem expects an integer answer, then perhaps the count is:</p>
<p>Total pets = 15 (closest integer to 14.5).</p>

<p>We need to find the total number of pets, but also there's the key information about the six pets with four legs.<br />
Let's analyze which pets have four legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each  </li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs (can't have legs)  </li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs each  </li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 6 pets have four legs, and cats and dogs are the likely candidates for four-legged pets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: ( C ), each with 4 legs  </li>
<li>Dogs: ( 2 ), each with 4 legs</li>
</ul>
<p>Other pets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs  </li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, the total number of four-legged pets:</p>
<p>[ 4 \times C + 4 \times D ]</p>
<p>which simplifies to:</p>
<p>[ 4C + 4 \times 2 = 4C + 8 ]</p>
<p>The total number of four-legged pets is 6:</p>
<p>[ 4C + 8 = 6 ]</p>
<p>Now, solve for ( C ):</p>
<p>[ 4C + 8 = 6 \Rightarrow 4C = -2 \Rightarrow C = -\frac{1}{2} ]</p>
<p>Negative half a pet is impossible, so this indicates no solution under current assumptions when considering only cats and dogs as four-legged pets to total precisely 6.</p>
<p>But the problem states: "Six of his pets have four legs." The phrase implies the total number of pets with four legs is 6, but it doesn't specify that only cats and dogs have four legs; perhaps some parrots or other pets with four legs (unlikely) or another pet is involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that not only cats and dogs have four legs.</p>
<p>Let's consider the possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>However, it's given that parrots have 2 legs, snakes 0, cats and dogs likely with four. So probably only cats and dogs have four legs in this context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that, the total four-legged pets:</p>
<p>[ 4C + 4D = 6 ]</p>
<p>but ( D=2 ), so:</p>
<p>[ 4C + 4 \times 2 = 6 \Rightarrow 4C +8=6 \Rightarrow 4C= -2 ]</p>
<p>again, impossible.</p>
<p>Is there a misinterpretation? Perhaps the phrase "Six of his pets have four legs" indicates that the total number of animals with four legs is 6, but the total pet count is more, and some pets are two-legged or legless.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the total number of four-legged pets includes only cats and dogs, and maybe some snakes with missing or abnormal legs, which seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Another approach: maybe "six of his pets have four legs" refers to the total number of pets with four legs, fitting only cats and dogs:</p>
<p>[ C + D = 6 ]</p>
<p>since only cats and dogs have four legs, and suggests:</p>
<p>[ C + D = 6 ]</p>
<p>but D=2, so:</p>
<p>[ C + 2 = 6 \Rightarrow C=4 ]</p>
<p>Now, the number of cats: ( C=4 )</p>
<p>Number of dogs: D=2</p>
<p>Check previous relationships:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Snakes: ( S= C +6= 4 +6=10 )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parrots: ( P= C -1= 4 -1=3 )</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, total pets:</p>
<p>[ C + S + P + D= 4 +10 +3 +2= 19 ]</p>
<p>Total number of pets = 19.</p>
<p>Verify whether the number of pets with four legs matches the 6 given:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 cats, each with 4 legs → total 4  </li>
<li>Dogs: 2 dogs, each with 4 legs → total 2  </li>
<li>
<p>Total four-legged pets: 4+2=6, which matches the statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parrots: 3, with 2 legs each, total 6 legs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Snakes: 10, 0 legs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This fits the data perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, the total number of pets is 19.</strong></p>
<p><think><br />
Yes, all conditions are satisfied with these values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4  </li>
<li>Snakes: 10  </li>
<li>Parrots: 3  </li>
<li>Dogs: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets: 4+10+3+2=19.</p>
<p>Number of pets with four legs: cats (4) + dogs (2) =6, matching the statement.</p>
<p>All relations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snakes: 6 more than cats: 4+6=10 → correct  </li>
<li>Parrots: 1 less than cats: 4-1=3 → correct  </li>
<li>Total with four legs: 4+2=6 → correct</li>
</ul>
<p>Each condition is fulfilled.  </p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's define variables to represent each type of pet:<br />
- Let C = number of cats<br />
- Let S = number of snakes<br />
- Let P = number of parrots<br />
- Let D = number of dogs (which we know is 2)</p>
<p>Given information:<br />
1. Frankie's snakes are 6 more than his cats: S = C + 6<br />
2. He has one less parrot than cats: P = C - 1<br />
3. He has 6 pets with 4 legs.<br />
4. D = 2 (dogs)</p>
<p>First, consider the total number of pets with 4 legs:<br />
- Cats have 4 legs: C<br />
- Dogs have 4 legs: 2<br />
- Snakes have 0 legs<br />
- Parrots have 2 legs (birds)</p>
<p>Total pets with 4 legs:<br />
C (cats) + 2 (dogs) = 6<br />
Total with 4 legs = 6</p>
<p>Total pets with 4 legs are all the cats plus the 2 dogs:<br />
C + 2 = 6<br />
Then,<br />
C = 6 - 2 = 4</p>
<p>Now find S and P:<br />
- S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 snakes<br />
- P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 parrots</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p><think> I have accounted for all the given information:<br />
- Number of cats: 4<br />
- Number of snakes: 10<br />
- Number of parrots: 3<br />
- Number of dogs: 2</p>
<p>Sum total:<br />
4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p>The total number of pets Frankie has is 19.<br />

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Let's define variables for the number of each type of pet Frankie has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let ( C ) be the number of cats.</li>
<li>Since Frankie's snakes are 6 more than cats, the number of snakes ( S = C + 6 ).</li>
<li>He has one less parrot than cats, so the number of parrots ( P = C - 1 ).</li>
<li>He has 2 dogs, so ( D = 2 ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's consider the total number of pets:</p>
<p>[ \text{Total pets} = C + S + P + D ]</p>
<p>Substitute the expressions:</p>
<p>[ \text{Total pets} = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 ]</p>
<p>Combine like terms:</p>
<p>[ \text{Total pets} = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2 ]<br />
[ = (C + C + C) + (6 - 1 + 2) ]<br />
[ = 3C + 7 ]</p>
<p>So, total pets in terms of ( C ):</p>
<p>[ T = 3C + 7 ]</p>
<p>Next, use the information about the number of pets with four legs. Six of his pets have four legs. Let's identify which pets can have four legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each (since he has 2 dogs)</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs each (birds)</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets with 4 legs:</p>
<p>[ \text{Number of four-legged pets} = \text{cats} + \text{dogs} = C + 2 ]</p>
<p>Given that <strong>6 of his pets have four legs</strong>, this:</p>
<p>[ C + 2 = 6 ]</p>
<p>Solve for ( C ):</p>
<p>[ C = 6 - 2 = 4 ]</p>
<p>Now, calculate the total number of pets:</p>
<p>[ T = 3C + 7 = 3 \times 4 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 ]</p>
<p>Check all details for consistency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: ( C = 4 )</li>
<li>Snakes: ( S = 4 + 6 = 10 )</li>
<li>Parrots: ( P = 4 - 1 = 3 )</li>
<li>Dogs: ( D = 2 )</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets:</p>
<p>[ 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 ]</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:</p>
<p>[ \text{cats} + \text{dogs} = 4 + 2 = 6 ] (matches the given info)</p>
