<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's carefully break down the problem step-by-step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells.</li>
<li>1 dozen = 12</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, Mimi picked up (2 \times 12 = 24) seashells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since Mimi has 24 shells, Kyle found (2 \times 24 = 48) shells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.</p>
</li>
<li>Kyle has 48 shells.</li>
<li>Leigh took (\frac{1}{3}) of 48, which is (\frac{1}{3} \times 48).</li>
</ol>
<p>Calculating this:<br />
(\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16).</p>
<p>Therefore, Leigh had 16 seashells.</p>

First, let's find out how many shells Mimi picked up. She picked up 2 dozen shells. Since 1 dozen = 12, then:<br />
Mimi's shells = 2 × 12 = 24 shells.</p>
<p>Next, Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So:<br />
Kyle's shells = 2 × 24 = 48 shells.</p>
<p>Leigh took one-third of the shells Kyle found:<br />
Leigh's shells = (1/3) × 48 = 16 shells.</p>

Let's carefully determine the number of seashells each person has.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells:<br />
   2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 shells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi:<br />
   Kyle's shells = 2 * 24 = 48 shells.</p>

<li>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of Kyle's shells:<br />
   Leigh's shells = (1/3) * 48 = 16 shells.</p>
</li>

<p>Now, just to verify:<br />
- Mimi: 24 shells<br />
- Kyle: 48 shells<br />
- Leigh: 16 shells</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>

Let's define variables for each type of pet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let C = number of cats</li>
<li>Let S = number of snakes</li>
<li>Let P = number of parrots</li>
<li>We know he has 2 dogs (D = 2)</li>
<li>The total number of pets will be the sum of all these.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Snakes: Frankie has six more snakes than cats:<br />
   S = C + 6</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parrots: He has one less parrot than cats:<br />
   P = C - 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dogs: He has 2 dogs:<br />
   D = 2</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Total pets (T) = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Substitute S and P:</p>
<p>T = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2<br />
t = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2<br />
Combine like terms:</p>
<p>T = (C + C + C) + (6 - 1 + 2)<br />
T = 3C + (7)</p>
<p>Now, the key piece of information: Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Which pets have four legs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats have four legs.</li>
<li>Dogs have four legs.</li>
<li>Snakes have no legs.</li>
<li>Parrots have two legs.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, pets with four legs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: C</li>
<li>Dogs: 2</li>
<li>Snakes: 0</li>
<li>Parrots: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Total number of four-legged pets:</p>
<p>C + 2</p>
<p>Given that:</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets = 6</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>C + 2 = 6<br />
C = 4</p>
<p>Now, find total pets:</p>
<p>T = 3C + 7<br />
T = 3*4 + 7<br />
T = 12 + 7<br />
T = 19</p>
<p>Let's double-check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: C = 4</li>
<li>Snakes: S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10</li>
<li>Parrots: P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3</li>
<li>Dogs: D = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Total:</p>
<p>4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:</p>
<p>Cats (4) + Dogs (2) = 6, which matches the given.</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for each type of pet:<br />
- Let C be the number of cats.<br />
- Let S be the number of snakes.<br />
- Let P be the number of parrots.<br />
- Let D be the number of dogs.<br />
- Let O be the number of other pets (if any).</p>
<p>Given data:<br />
1. He has 6 more snakes than cats: S = C + 6.<br />
2. He has one less parrot than cats: P = C - 1.<br />
3. He has 2 dogs: D = 2.<br />
4. Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Now, consider the number of legs:<br />
- Cats have 4 legs each.<br />
- Snakes and parrots have fewer or no legs:<br />
  - Snakes have 0 legs.<br />
  - Parrots have 2 legs.<br />
- Dogs have 4 legs.<br />
- Other pets: unspecified, but likely 4 legs unless indicated otherwise.</p>
<p>Since exactly six pets have four legs, we can consider:<br />
Number of four-legged pets:<br />
- Cats: C (4 legs each)<br />
- Snakes: 0 legs<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs each<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each<br />
- Other pets: unknown</p>
<p>Sum of pets with four legs:<br />
cats (C) + dogs (2) + any other four-legged pets.</p>
<p>Let's write total four-legged pets:<br />
Number of four-legged pets = C (cats) + 2 (dogs) + (number of other four-legged pets).</p>
<p>Since the total number of pets with four legs is exactly six, we need to see which combination of these counts yields exactly six.</p>
<p>Let's check with assumptions:</p>
<p>Case 1:<br />
Suppose no other pets:<br />
Number of four-legged pets = C + 2 (dogs).</p>
<p>Set this equal to 6:<br />
C + 2 = 6<br />
C = 4</p>
<p>Given C = 4,<br />
S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 snakes<br />
P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 parrots<br />
D = 2 dogs</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p>Check the number of four-legged pets:<br />
Cats: 4<br />
Dogs: 2<br />
Parrots: 3 (but only 2 legs each, so aren't we counting only those with four legs separately?)<br />
The problem states that six of his pets have four legs, which matches cats (4) + dogs (2) = 6, so total 6.</p>
<p>This satisfies all conditions:<br />
- S = 10 (more snakes than cats), as 10 = 4 + 6 → OK.<br />
- P = 3, and P = C - 1 → 3 = 4 - 1 → OK.<br />
- Six pets have four legs: cats (4) + dogs (2) = 6 → OK.<br />
- Total pets: 19.</p>
<p>Now, verify the logic:<br />
Number of pets with 4 legs:<br />
- Cats: 4<br />
- Dogs: 2<br />
Total = 6, matches the given.</p>
<p>So, the total number of pets Frankie has is 19.</p>
<p><think><br />
The key was recognizing the pets with four legs and their counts, then verifying the relation with the total number of pets and that the counts fit all constraints.</p>

<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for each type of pet:<br />
- Let ( C ) be the number of cats.<br />
- Since Frankie has six more snakes than cats, snakes = ( C + 6 ).<br />
- He has one less parrot than cats, so parrots = ( C - 1 ).<br />
- He has 2 dogs, as given.</p>
<p>Now, total pets: <br />
[ \text{Total} = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 ]<br />
Simplify:<br />
[ \text{Total} = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2 = 3C + 7 ]</p>
<p>Next, the key piece of information:<br />
- Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Let's analyze which pets have four legs:<br />
- Cats: 4 legs each<br />
- Snakes: 0 legs each<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs each<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each</p>
<p>Total pets with four legs:<br />
[ \text{Cats} + \text{Dogs} = C + 2 ]<br />
(Since snakes and parrots don't have four legs)</p>
<p>Given that exactly 6 pets have four legs, we have:<br />
[ C + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[<br />
C = 4<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, compute the number of each pet:<br />
- Cats: ( C = 4 )<br />
- Snakes: ( C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 )<br />
- Parrots: ( C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 )<br />
- Dogs: 2</p>
<p>Total number of pets:<br />
[ \text{Total} = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 ]</p>
<p>Double check:<br />
- Pets with 4 legs:<br />
  - Cats: 4<br />
  - Dogs: 2<br />
  Total: 6, which matches the given info.</p>

Let's identify each type of pet Frankie has and assign variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>C = number of cats</li>
<li>S = number of snakes</li>
<li>P = number of parrots</li>
<li>D = number of dogs</li>
<li>Others (if any) are not specified, but the problem only refers to these pets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given data:<br />
1. He has six more snakes than cats: S = C + 6<br />
2. He has one less parrot than cats: P = C - 1<br />
3. He has 2 dogs: D = 2<br />
4. Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Now, analyze the number of legs contributed by each pet type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs each</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets:<br />
Total = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />
Legs = (4 * C) + (0 * S) + (2 * P) + (4 * D)</p>
<p>Substitute S, P, D in terms of C:</p>
<ul>
<li>S = C + 6</li>
<li>P = C - 1</li>
<li>D = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets:<br />
Total = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2 = (C + C + C) + (6 - 1 + 2) = 3C + 7</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />
Legs = 4C + 0 + 2(C - 1) + 4(2)</p>
<p>Calculate step by step:<br />
- 4C<br />
- 2(C - 1) = 2C - 2<br />
- 4(2) = 8</p>
<p>Sum:<br />
Legs = 4C + (2C - 2) + 8 = (4C + 2C) + (-2 + 8) = 6C + 6</p>
<p>Given that six of the pets have four legs:<br />
These six pets must all have four legs. Which pets have four legs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each</li>
</ul>
<p>Snakes: 0 legs<br />
Parrots: 2 legs</p>
<p>We need a total of six pets with four legs. The options:<br />
- Only cats and dogs contribute 4 legs each.</p>
<p>Total cats and dogs:<br />
C + D = C + 2</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets:<br />
(Cats + Dogs) = C + 2, which must be equal to 6 (because six pets have four legs).</p>
<p>Set:<br />
C + 2 = 6<br />
=&gt; C = 4</p>
<p>Once C = 4, find S and P:</p>
<p>S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10<br />
P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3<br />
D = 2 (given)</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
Total = C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p>Check the number of pets with four legs:<br />
Cats: 4 (4 legs each)<br />
Dogs: 2 (4 legs each)<br />

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for each type of pet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let C = number of cats</li>
<li>Let S = number of snakes</li>
<li>Let P = number of parrots</li>
<li>Let D = number of dogs</li>
</ul>
<p>Given information:<br />
1. Frankie's number of snakes is six more than cats:<br />
   S = C + 6</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He has one less parrot than cats:<br />
   P = C - 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has 2 dogs:<br />
   D = 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pets and their legs:<br />
- Cats: 4 legs each<br />
- Snakes: 0 legs each<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs each<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
Total_pets = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />
From the problem, six pets have four legs, so sum the legs for these six pets. </p>
<p>Possible combinations for six pets with four legs:<br />
- All six are cats and dogs (since parrots have only 2 legs, snakes have 0). </p>
<p>Let's analyze scenarios to match the six pets with four legs:</p>
<p>Option 1:<br />
- All six are cats and dogs, only cats and dogs have four legs.<br />
- Since D = 2, and dogs have four legs:<br />
  - Number of cats among these six pets: C_in_6<br />
  - Number of dogs among these six pets: D_in_6 (which is 2)</p>
<p>Number of these six pets: C_in_6 + D_in_6 = 6  </p>
<p>Given D_in_6 = 2 (since all 2 dogs are among the six four-legged pets), then:<br />
C_in_6 = 6 - 2 = 4</p>
<p>Total cats: C</p>
<p>Total cats outside the six pets: C - C_in_6 = C - 4</p>
<p>Total snakes: S = C + 6</p>
<p>Total parrots: P = C - 1</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
Total_pets = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />
- From the six four-legged pets:<br />
  4 cats + 2 dogs = (4 × 4) + (2 × 4) = 16 + 8 = 24 legs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remaining cats:<br />
  (C - 4) cats, each with 4 legs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remaining snakes:<br />
  (C + 6) snakes, each with 0 legs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remaining parrots:<br />
  (C - 1) parrots, each with 2 legs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total legs in entire collection:<br />
Total_legs = legs from all pets</p>
<p>Let's sum total legs:<br />
Total_legs = [legs from the 4 cats among the six pets] + [legs from the 2 dogs] + [legs from remaining cats] + [legs from snakes] + [legs from parrots]</p>
<p>Calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 cats in the six pets: 4 × 4 = 16 legs</li>
<li>2 dogs: 2 × 4 = 8 legs</li>
<li>Remaining cats: (C - 4) × 4 legs</li>
<li>Snakes: (C + 6) × 0 = 0</li>
<li>Parrots: (C - 1) × 2 legs</li>
</ul>
<p>Total legs:<br />
= 16 + 8 + (C - 4) × 4 + 0 + (C - 1) × 2</p>
<p>Simplify:<br />
Total_legs = 24 + 4(C - 4) + 2(C - 1)</p>
<p>= 24 + 4C - 16 + 2C - 2</p>
<p>= (24 - 16 - 2) + (4C + 2C)</p>
<p>= 6 + 6C</p>
<p>The total number of legs depends on C, but the problem likely expects a total pet count.</p>
<p>Since the total number of pets must be an integer, and given that all variables are counts of pets:</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
= C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Recall:<br />
S = C + 6<br />
P = C - 1<br />
D = 2</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
= C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2<br />
= C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2<br />
= (C + C + C) + (6 - 1 + 2)<br />
= 3C + 7</p>
<p>Now, the total number of legs:<br />
= 6 + 6C</p>
<p>Since legs can be counted precisely, but the total pet count is expressed as 3C + 7, let's find a reasonable value for C that makes total legs and total pets consistent.</p>
<p>Is there any additional constraint? The problem states six pets have four legs, and we've assigned that to cats and dogs among the six pets.</p>
<p>We've assigned:<br />
- 4 cats and 2 dogs among the six four-legged pets.</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />
= 24 + 4(C - 4) + 2(C - 1)<br />
= 24 + 4C - 16 + 2C - 2<br />
= 6 + 6C</p>
<p>Regardless of C, the total pets is 3C + 7.</p>
<p>Check if total legs matches total pet count:</p>
<p>Suppose total legs = number of pets × average legs per pet (roughly).</p>
<p>But more straightforwardly, note that the total number of pets is:</p>
<p>Total pets = 3C + 7.</p>
<p>To find an integer solution, pick C such that P ≥ 0 and S ≥ 0:</p>
<ul>
<li>P = C - 1 ≥ 0 → C ≥ 1</li>
<li>S = C + 6 ≥ 0 → C ≥ -6 (which is always true)</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the total number of pets should be positive. Let's try C = 4:</p>
<p>C=4:</p>
<p>Total pets = 3(4) + 7 = 12 +7 = 19</p>
<p>Check the counts:</p>
<ul>
<li>S= C + 6= 4 + 6= 10</li>
<li>P= C - 1= 3</li>
<li>D= 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets: 4 + 10 + 3 + 2= 19. OK.</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />
= 6 + 6C=6 + 6×4=6 + 24=30 legs.</p>
<p>Count the six pets with four legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 cats and 2 dogs among the six pets:</li>
</ul>
<p>which matches 4 cats (4×4=16 legs) and 2 dogs (2×4=8 legs), total 24 legs.</p>
<p>Remaining:<br />
- Cats outside: 4 - 4 = 0<br />
- Snakes: 10 snakes<br />
- Parrots: 3 parrots</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />
- Snakes: 0<br />
- Parrots: 3×2=6<br />
- Remaining cats: 0<br />
- Total legs: 16 (cats in six pets) +8 (dogs) +6 (parrots) +0 (snakes) = 16+8+6=30 legs, matching the total legs.</p>
<p>This confirms the consistency.</p>
<p>Total number of pets:<br />

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think> Let's carefully analyze the problem and define variables for each type of pet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let ( C ) be the number of cats.</li>
<li>Since Frankie's pets include snakes, parrots, dogs, and possibly other animals, but from the problem: </li>
<li>He has 6 more snakes than cats, so number of snakes ( S = C + 6 ).</li>
<li>He has one less parrot than cats, so parrots ( P = C - 1 ).</li>
<li>He has 2 dogs, so ( D = 2 ).</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of pets (( T )) will be:<br />
[ T = C + S + P + D ]<br />
Substitute the known expressions:<br />
[ T = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 ]</p>
<p>Combine like terms:<br />
[ T = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2 ]<br />
[ T = (C + C + C) + (6 - 1 + 2) ]<br />
[ T = 3C + 7 ]</p>
<p>Now, the problem states:<br />
<em>Six of his pets have four legs.</em> What animals have four legs?<br />
- Cats: 4 legs<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs<br />
- Snakes and parrots: don't have four legs (snakes have none, parrots have two)</p>
<p>So, total pets with four legs are cats and dogs:<br />
- Number of four-legged pets: ( C + D )</p>
<p>Given that total four-legged pets are 6:<br />
[ C + D = 6 ]</p>
<p>But ( D = 2 ) which is given.</p>
<p>Therefore:<br />
[ C + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[ C = 4 ]</p>
<p>Now, find total pets:<br />
[ T = 3C + 7 ]<br />
[ T = 3 \times 4 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 ]</p>
<p><strong>Check</strong>:<br />
- Cats ( C = 4 )<br />
- Snakes ( S = 4 + 6 = 10 )<br />
- Parrots ( P = 4 - 1 = 3 )<br />
- Dogs ( D = 2 )<br />
Total pets:<br />
[ 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 ]</p>
<p>Verify the number of four-legged pets:<br />
[ Cats + Dogs = 4 + 2 = 6 ]<br />
Matches the given information.</p>
<p><think> The calculations seem consistent. The total number of pets Frankie has is 19.</think></p>
