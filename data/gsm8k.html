<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think> Let's carefully analyze the problem step-by-step.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Since 1 dozen = 12 shells, Mimi picked up:<br />
   2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24 shells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi:<br />
   Number of shells Kyle found = 2 × 24 = 48.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leigh took one-third of the shells that Kyle found:<br />
   Number of shells Leigh took = (1/3) × 48 = 16.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, Leigh had 16 shells.</p>

Let's break down the problem step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells.</li>
<li>Since 1 dozen = 12, 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 shells.</li>

<li>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi.</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for each type of pet:<br />
- let c = number of cats<br />
- let s = number of snakes<br />
- let p = number of parrots<br />
- and we know he has 2 dogs, which is fixed.</p>
<p>Given information:<br />
1. Frankie's pets include snakes, cats, parrots, and dogs.<br />
2. He has six more snakes than cats: s = c + 6.<br />
3. He has one less parrot than cats: p = c - 1.<br />
4. Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Now, the key is to interpret the phrase "Six of his pets have four legs." <br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each.<br />
- Cats: 4 legs each.<br />
- Snakes: 0 legs each.<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs each.</p>
<p>Since snakes don't have four legs, and parrots have 2, only cats and dogs have four legs. The total number of pets with four legs is:</p>
<p>Number of cats (c) + number of dogs (2) = 6</p>
<p>From that:<br />
c + 2 = 6<br />
=&gt; c = 4</p>
<p>Now that we have c, we can find s and p:</p>
<p>s = c + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10<br />
p = c - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
- cats: 4<br />
- snakes: 10<br />
- parrots: 3<br />
- dogs: 2</p>
<p>Total number of pets = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p><think> We've accounted for all constraints: the number of four-legged pets sums correctly, and the relationships between snakes and cats, parrots and cats are consistent. The total pet count appears correct based on all conditions.</think></p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think> Let's define variables for the number of each type of pet:<br />
- ( C ) = number of cats<br />
- ( S ) = number of snakes<br />
- ( P ) = number of parrots<br />
- ( D ) = number of dogs (given as 2)</p>
<p>Given:<br />
1. Frankie's snakes: ( S = C + 6 ) (since he has six more snakes than cats)<br />
2. Parrots: ( P = C - 1 ) (since he has one less parrot than cats)<br />
3. Dogs: ( D = 2 ) (given)<br />
4. Total pets with four legs: 6 pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Now, count the legs for each pet:<br />
- Cats: 4 legs each<br />
- Snakes: 0 legs<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs each<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
[ \text{Total} = C + S + P + D ]</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />
[ 4C + 0 \times S + 2P + 4D ]</p>
<p>Total pets with four legs:<br />
- All cats: 4 legs each → ( C )<br />
- Snakes: 0 legs → 0<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs each → ( P )<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each → ( D )</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets:<br />
[ C + P + D ]</p>
<p>Given total four-legged pets is 6:<br />
[ C + P + D = 6 ]</p>
<p>Substitute ( P = C - 1 ) and ( D = 2 ):<br />
[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]</p>
<p>Simplify:<br />
[ C + C - 1 + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C = 5 ]<br />
[ C = 2.5 ]</p>
<p>But the number of pets must be integers, so this suggests we need to consider only integer solutions. Let's re-express the problem or check for possible oversight.</p>
<p>Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted: it's possible the total "six pets have four legs" refers to number of individual pets (regardless of the total). Wait, but we did that correctly.</p>
<p>Is it possible that 6 pets with four legs is total? That makes sense.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps I made an oversight assuming the total four-legged pets are ( C + P + D ). Is this accurate? Let's revisit that.</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets are:<br />
- Cats: ( C ) (each 4 legs)<br />
- Snakes: 0<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs each, total ( P )<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each, total ( D = 2 )</p>
<p>Total number of four-legged pets:<br />
[ C + P + D ] (since snakes are 0)</p>
<p>And that total is 6:</p>
<p>[ C + P + D = 6 ]</p>
<p>Again, substitute ( P = C - 1 ) and ( D = 2 ):</p>
<p>[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]</p>
<p>Simplify:</p>
<p>[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]</p>
<p>[ 2C = 5 ]</p>
<p>Again, non-integer, which suggests an inconsistency.</p>
<p>Is there an oversight? Let's re-express:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of pets: ( C + S + P + D )</li>
<li>The total number of four-legged pets: number of cats + parrots + dogs</li>
</ul>
<p>Total four-legged pets:</p>
<p>[ C + P + D = 6 ]</p>
<p>Using ( P = C - 1 ), ( D = 2 ):</p>
<p>[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]</p>
<p>[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]</p>
<p>[ 2C = 5 ]</p>
<p>No integer solution.</p>
<p>So perhaps the assumption that total four-legged pets are just those with 4 legs is correct, but the problem says "Six of his pets have four legs." — It is ambiguous whether total four-legged pets are six, which makes sense, or whether six is the number of pets with four legs.</p>
<p>Alternatively, could the "six of his pets have four legs" be the total number of four-legged pets? If so, then the sum is 6.</p>
<p>In that case:</p>
<p>[ \text{Total four-legged pets} = 6 ]</p>
<p>And the sum of cats, parrots, and dogs (excluding snakes, which have no legs):</p>
<p>[ C + P + D = 6 ]</p>
<p>Now, with ( D=2 ), ( P=C-1 ):<br />
[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C = 5 ]<br />
Again, no integer solution.</p>
<p>Suppose instead, there's a mistake: perhaps "He has six more snakes than cats" means ( S = C + 6 ).</p>
<p>He has one less parrot than cats: ( P = C - 1 ).</p>
<p>He has 2 dogs: ( D=2 ).</p>
<p>Total with four legs: 6.</p>
<p>Now, considering total with four legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each, total ( C ),</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs,</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs each, total ( P ),</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each, total ( D ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Total four-legged pets:</p>
<p>[ C + P + D ]</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets = 6.</p>
<p>Use ( P = C - 1 ), ( D=2 ):</p>
<p>[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]</p>
<p>[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]</p>
<p>Again, ( 2C = 5 ), no integer solution. So perhaps the total number of pets with four legs is 6, and the total pets with four legs are cats, parrots, dogs, but snakes are zero legs and do not contribute to that sum.</p>
<p>Now, is it possible that the number of pets with 4 legs is the total number of cats plus dogs plus parrots, and snakes don't contribute? Putting it differently, the total number of four-legged pets is:</p>
<p>[ \text{Number of cats} + \text{number of parrots} + \text{number of dogs} = 6 ]</p>
<p>Substituting ( P = C - 1 ), ( D=2 ):</p>
<p>[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C= 5 ]<br />
Again, incompatible.</p>
<p>Possibility: perhaps I made a miscalculations regarding the initial interpretation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the problem states: "Six of his pets have four legs" indicates the <strong>number</strong> of pets with four legs, not total types with four legs. So, total.</p>
<p>Given that, let's look for integer solutions:</p>
<p>Try ( C=3 ):</p>
<ul>
<li>( P=2 ),</li>
<li>( S= C+6= 3+6= 9 ),</li>
<li>D=2 (given).</li>
</ul>
<p>Total cats: 3</p>
<p>Total snakes: 9</p>
<p>Total parrots: 2</p>
<p>Total dogs: 2</p>
<p>Total pets: ( 3 + 9 + 2 + 2 = 16 ).</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 3,</li>
<li>Parrots: 2,</li>
<li>Dogs: 2,</li>
<li>Snakes: 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sum:</p>
<p>[ 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 ]</p>
<p>which exceeds 6.</p>
<p>Try ( C=2 ):</p>
<ul>
<li>( P=1 ),</li>
<li>( S= 2 + 6=8 ),</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets: ( 2 + 8 + 1 + 2= 13 ).</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:</p>
<p>[ 2 (cats) + 1(parrots) + 2(dogs) = 5 ]</p>
<p>less than 6. Close.</p>
<p>Try ( C=4 ):</p>
<ul>
<li>( P=3 ),</li>
<li>( S= 4 + 6=10 ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets: ( 4 + 10 + 3 + 2= 19 ).</p>
<p>Number of four-legged:</p>
<p>[ 4 + 3 + 2= 9 ], too many.</p>
<p>Our goal is exactly 6 pets with four legs.</p>
<p>From earlier calculations, the only possible ( C ) that makes total four-legged pets exactly 6 is:</p>
<p>[ C + P + D = 6 ]</p>
<p>Recall ( P= C - 1 ), ( D=2 ), substitute:</p>
<p>[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C + 1=6 ]<br />
[ 2C=5 ]</p>
<p>No integer solution—this indicates an inconsistency unless perhaps the total number of four-legged pets is not ( C + P + D ), but only those that are cats, parrots, and dogs, and snakes are ignored because they have no legs.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps snakes are not included in the four-legged count, and the "six animals with four legs" refers to a total count of 6 animals with four legs, summing over the appropriate pets.</p>
<p>Given the previous calculations, the closest integer solution is with ( C=2 ):</p>
<ul>
<li>( P=1 ),</li>
<li>( S=8 ),</li>
<li>total pets: 13,</li>
<li>pets with four legs: cats(2), parrots(1), dogs(2) = 5, which is under 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, with ( C=3 ):</p>
<ul>
<li>( P=2 ),</li>
<li>snakes=9,</li>
<li>total pets= 16,</li>
<li>four-legged pets: 3+2+2=7, over 6.</li>

<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for each type of pet:<br />
- Let ( C ) = number of cats<br />
- Let ( S ) = number of snakes<br />
- Let ( P ) = number of parrots<br />
- Let ( D ) = number of dogs<br />
- Let ( T ) = total number of pets</p>
<p>From the problem, we have:<br />
1. He has 6 more snakes than cats:<br />
[ S = C + 6 ]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He has 1 less parrot than cats:<br />
[ P = C - 1 ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has 2 dogs:<br />
[ D = 2 ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A total of six pets have four legs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, considering the number of legs:<br />
- Cats have 4 legs each.<br />
- Snakes have no legs.<br />
- Parrots have 2 legs each.<br />
- Dogs have 4 legs each.</p>
<p>Let's write an expression for the total number of legs:</p>
<p>Total legs:<br />
[ 4 \times C \text{ (cats)} + 0 \text{ (snakes)} + 2 \times P \text{ (parrots)} + 4 \times D \text{ (dogs)} ]</p>
<p>Substituting ( P = C - 1 ) and ( D = 2 ):</p>
<p>[<br />
L = 4C + 0 + 2(C - 1) + 4 \times 2 <br />

[<br />
L = 4C + 2C - 2 + 8<br />
]<br />
[<br />
L = (4C + 2C) + (8 - 2)<br />
]<br />
[<br />
L = 6C + 6<br />
]</p>
<p>We know that exactly six pets have four legs. Which pets are those? Usually, it's cats and dogs because snakes don’t have legs and parrots have only two.</p>
<p>Number of pets with four legs:<br />
[<br />
C + D = 4 \text{ (cats)} + 2 \text{ (dogs)} = 6<br />
]</p>
<p>This matches the total count of pets with four legs, which is 6, so:<br />
[<br />
C + D = 6<br />
]</p>
<p>But since ( D = 2 ), then:<br />
[<br />
C + 2 = 6 \implies C = 4<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, find the other numbers:<br />
- ( C = 4 )<br />
- ( P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 )<br />
- ( S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 )<br />
- ( D = 2 ) (already known)</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
[<br />
T= C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19<br />

<p>Check: <br />
- Pets with four legs: Cats (4) and Dogs (2) sum to 6, which matches the given info.<br />
- All values consistent.</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's carefully analyze the problem and set up variables to represent the number of each type of pet.</p>
<p>Let:<br />
C = number of cats<br />
S = number of snakes<br />
P = number of parrots<br />
D = number of dogs<br />
Total pets = T</p>
<p>Given:<br />
- Frankie's pets include snakes, cats, parrots, and dogs.<br />
- He has 6 more snakes than cats: S = C + 6<br />
- He has 1 less parrot than cats: P = C - 1<br />
- He has 2 dogs: D = 2</p>
<p>Now, the total number of pets is:<br />
T = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Substitute S, P, and D:<br />
T = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2</p>
<p>Simplify:<br />
T = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2<br />
T = (C + C + C) + (6 - 1 + 2)<br />
T = 3C + 7</p>
<p>Now, we need to find the total number of pets, but there's an additional piece of information:<br />
- Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>First, we identify the number of legs each pet has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs each</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs each</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each</li>
</ul>
<p>Total legs among all pets:<br />
L = (Number of cats × 4) + (Number of snakes × 0) + (Number of parrots × 2) + (Number of dogs × 4)<br />
L = 4C + 0 + 2P + 4D</p>
<p>Substitute P and D:<br />
L = 4C + 2(C - 1) + 4(2)<br />
L = 4C + 2C - 2 + 8<br />
L = (4C + 2C) + (8 - 2)<br />
L = 6C + 6</p>
<p>The problem states: "Six of his pets have four legs." Since snakes have 0 legs, the pets with four legs are cats, parrots, and dogs. This means exactly 6 pets with four legs.</p>
<p>Number of pets with four legs:<br />
Number of cats + number of parrots + number of dogs = 6<br />
Using variables:<br />
C + P + D = 6</p>
<p>Substitute P and D:<br />
C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6<br />
C + C - 1 + 2 = 6<br />
(2C) + 1 = 6<br />
2C = 5<br />
C = 2.5</p>
<p>But C represents a number of pets, which must be an integer, so C = 2.5 isn't possible — this indicates inconsistency unless our assumptions are invalid or we need to reconsider.</p>
<p>Let's revisit this logic.</p>
<p>Assuming the initial set of variables, note that the only pets with four legs are cats and dogs, and parrots have two.</p>
<p>Now, the animal counts with four legs:<br />
Cats + Dogs = 6<br />
Because parrots have only 2 legs, they are not included in the 6 perfect four-legged pets.</p>
<p>Given:<br />
C + D = 6<br />
We already know D = 2, from the problem.</p>
<p>Thus:<br />
C + 2 = 6<br />
C = 4</p>
<p>Now, check P:<br />
P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3</p>
<p>Check total pets:<br />
S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10</p>
<p>Now, total pets T:<br />
T = C + S + P + D<br />
T = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p>Verify that in total six pets have four legs:<br />
- Cats: 4 (4 legs)<br />
- Dogs: 2 (4 legs)<br />
- Parrots: 3 (2 legs each)<br />
- Snakes: 10 (0 legs)</p>
<p>Total with four legs:<br />
Cats + Dogs = 4 + 2 = 6, which matches the given.</p>
<p>Total number of pets:<br />
\boxed{19}<br />

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Let's define variables for each type of pet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let ( c ) be the number of cats.</li>
<li>The number of snakes is ( c + 6 ) (since Frankie's have 6 more snakes than cats).</li>
<li>The number of parrots is ( c - 1 ) (he has one less parrot than cats).</li>
<li>Number of dogs is given as 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the total number of pets is:</p>
<p>[<br />
\text{Total pets} = c + (c + 6) + (c - 1) + 2<br />
]</p>
<p>Combine like terms:</p>
<p>[<br />
= c + c + 6 + c - 1 + 2<br />
]<br />
[<br />
= (c + c + c) + (6 - 1 + 2)<br />
]<br />
[<br />
= 3c + 7<br />
]</p>
<p>Next, we are told that six of his pets have four legs. Let's analyze which pets could have four legs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each.</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs.</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs.</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets with four legs:</p>
<p>[<br />
\text{cats} + \text{dogs} = c + 2<br />
]</p>
<p>Given that exactly six pets have four legs:</p>
<p>[<br />
c + 2 = 6<br />
]</p>
<p>Solve for ( c ):</p>
<p>[<br />
c = 6 - 2 = 4<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, find the total number of pets:</p>
<p>[<br />
\text{Total} = 3c + 7 = 3 \times 4 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19<br />
]</p>
<p><strong>Final check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4</li>
<li>Snakes: ( 4 + 6 = 10 )</li>
<li>Parrots: ( 4 - 1 = 3 )</li>
<li>Dogs: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Verify total with four-legged pets:</p>
<p>Cats (4) + Dogs (2) = 6 — correct.</p>
<p>Total pets: 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 — matches our calculation.</p>
<p><think>Everything checks out. The total number of pets Frankie has is 19.</think></p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for the number of each type of pet:<br />
- Let C = number of cats<br />
- Let S = number of snakes<br />
- Let P = number of parrots<br />
- Let D = number of dogs</p>
<p>From the problem, we have:<br />
1. Frankie's snakes are 6 more than his cats: S = C + 6<br />
2. He has one less parrot than cats: P = C - 1<br />
3. He has 2 dogs: D = 2</p>
<p>Total pets = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Additionally, six of his pets have four legs. Typically, the most common four-legged animals in the list are cats, dogs, and parrots do not have four legs (parrots have wings, so they are not four-legged animals). Snakes have no legs. Therefore, the pets with four legs are:<br />
- Cats (each with 4 legs)<br />
- Dogs (each with 4 legs)<br />
- Parrots do not have 4 legs, as they are birds with wings, so they are not counted here.</p>
<p>Given that, the total number of four-legged pets is:<br />
Number of cats + number of dogs = C + 2</p>
<p>This sum is six:<br />
C + 2 = 6</p>
<p>From this, we can solve for C:<br />
C = 6 - 2 = 4</p>
<p>Now, find S and P:<br />
S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10<br />
P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3</p>
<p>Verify the total number of pets:<br />
Total = C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p>Check the count of four-legged pets:<br />
Cats (4) + dogs (2) = 6 → matches the given info, so consistent.</p>
<p>Hence, Frankie has a total of 19 pets.</p>
