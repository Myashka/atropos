intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

EXAMPLES:

Scenario 1: As France, after discussing a joint move against Germany with England, while Italy seems to be posturing aggressively in Piedmont.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure new supply centers to reach 18. Currently, our supply centers are in Edinburgh, Liverpool, and London. We need to push into nearby unclaimed centers, especially Belgium, Holland, and potentially Scandinavia, to build a strong foothold.

- The immediate focus should be on consolidating control of the North Sea and English Channel, which are critical for future expansion.
- Moving F EDI to NTH (North Sea) is a strong opening move to threaten Germany and prepare for future expansion into Scandinavia.
- Supporting F LON to YOR (Yorkshire) helps secure our western flank and prepares for potential moves into Belgium or Holland.
- Moving A LVP (Liverpool) to YOR (Yorkshire) is a strategic move to threaten northern German centers and prepare for expansion into Belgium or Holland.
- We should also consider supporting moves to secure our home centers and prepare for future pushes.

Given the current map and our friendly relations with France, we can avoid immediate conflict with them and focus on weakening Germany and expanding into the Low Countries.

**Orders:**

- F EDI - NTH (to threaten Germany and prepare for Scandinavia)
- F LON S F BRE - YOR (support move to secure Yorkshire)
- A LVP - YOR (to threaten German centers and prepare for expansion)
- Support moves to strengthen our position and prepare for future expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate goal is to expand aggressively into neutral and contested supply centers to build a strong position. Currently, our units are positioned in Berlin, Kiel, and Munich, with potential to push outward.

- **Kiel (KIE)**: The fleet here is well-placed to threaten Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL). Moving to DEN or HOL will help us secure these centers early, which are crucial for expansion and controlling the North Sea.
- **Berlin (BER)**: Holding is safe for now, but we could consider supporting moves to push into the Baltic or support an attack on the Russian front if opportunities arise.
- **Munich (MUN)**: We should aim to take the nearby centers of Belgium (BEL) and possibly support an attack into the Netherlands (NED) or France if the opportunity presents itself.

Given the current map and the possible moves, I will:
- Use the fleet in KIE to move to DEN to threaten or take it.
- Support the army in MUN to move into BEL, aiming to secure that center.
- Keep the army in BER on hold to defend against Russian or Austrian threats.
- Prepare for potential future moves into the Netherlands or further east.

This aggressive stance will help us secure key centers early, setting the stage for rapid expansion toward 18 centers.

**Orders:**
- F KIE - DEN (to threaten or take Denmark)
- A MUN - BEL (to secure Belgium)
- A BER H (hold for now)
- F HOL H (hold, or support if needed later)
- Support moves or adjustments can be made next turn based on responses.

*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and secure key supply centers. Currently, Russia controls MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR, with potential to push further into the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Our immediate focus should be on consolidating our holdings and probing weaknesses in neighboring powers, especially Austria, Germany, and Turkey, to identify opportunities for expansion.

- **MOS**: I will support a move to LVN to threaten the Baltic and potentially cut off German access to the east, while also preparing to threaten BUD or RUM if opportunities arise.
- **SEV**: I will move F SEV to ARM to threaten Turkey and open a front in the south, while also supporting a move to RUM to threaten the Black Sea region.
- **WAR**: I will move A WAR to GAL to threaten Austria and open a new front in the west, aiming to destabilize Austria and gain more centers.
- **Support and flexibility**: I will hold units in MOS and WAR to support future moves, and keep options open for supporting or attacking based on diplomacy.

This approach aims to pressure Austria and Turkey, while positioning for expansion into RUM, BUD, and potentially the Balkans. I will also keep an eye on the German and Turkish front, ready to shift if opportunities or threats emerge.

**Orders:**

- A MOS S A WAR (support WAR to GAL)
- A MOS - LVN (move MOS to LVN to threaten the Baltic)
- F SEV - ARM (move SEV to ARM to threaten Turkey)
- F SEV S A BUD (support BUD from SEV)
- A WAR - GAL (advance WAR to threaten Austria)

This aggressive stance should help us expand in the east and destabilize our neighbors, setting the stage for further expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate goal is to expand Italy’s influence and secure additional supply centers to move toward the 18 needed for victory. Currently, our units are positioned in Naples, Rome, and Venice, with no immediate threats. France remains friendly, which is advantageous for cooperation in the south and west. Austria, Germany, and Turkey are unfriendly, so we should be cautious about overextending eastward without strong alliances.

In this phase, I will focus on consolidating our position in Italy and preparing to push into the Balkans and the Mediterranean. The most promising move is to take Trieste from Austria, as it is a key supply center and close to our current holdings. Supporting Venice’s army in attacking Trieste will increase our chances of success. The fleet in Naples can support the attack from the sea if needed, or reposition to defend or threaten other centers.

Given Austria’s units (F TRI, A VIE, A BUD), they are somewhat overextended, and their fleet in TRI is vulnerable. Moving our army from Venice to Trieste with support from Apulia (A APU) and Ionian Sea (F ION) will give us a strong chance to take Trieste. Our fleet in NAP can move to the Tyrrhenian Sea to defend against French or other threats, or support our land attack if needed.

We should also keep an eye on Greece and TUN, as they are nearby and could be targets or opportunities later. For now, the priority is to secure Trieste.

**Order plan:**
- A VEN to TRI supported by A APU and F ION
- A APU to support A VEN to TRI (to ensure success)
- F ION to support A VEN to TRI (to reinforce the attack)
- Keep Rome and Naples on hold for now, as no immediate threats are present.

This move will help us gain a critical supply center and set the stage for further expansion into the Balkans and the Mediterranean.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia, leveraging our friendly relations with Russia to contain Austria and prevent encirclement. The current positions suggest that we can push into Bulgaria (BUL) and Rumelia (RUM) to secure additional supply centers, which are critical for reaching our 18-center goal.

- The fleet in Ankara (F ANK) has multiple options: support the move into Bulgaria (BUL) or Rumelia (RUM), or threaten the Black Sea (SEV) to pressure Russia.
- The army in Constantinople (A CON) can move to Bulgaria (BUL) to secure that key center or support the army in Smyrna (A SMY) to push into Rumelia.
- The army in Smyrna (A SMY) can either support the move into Rumelia or attempt to take Bulgaria directly if the opportunity arises.
- Supporting the fleet in Ankara to move into Bulgaria will be a strong move to secure a vital center.
- Moving Ankara to the Black Sea (SEV) could threaten Russia's holdings and open a new front, but given our friendly relations with Russia, a more cautious approach is preferable this turn.

The main goal is to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia quickly, then turn our attention to Sevastopol and other centers. We should also keep an eye on Austria and Italy, but our focus remains on expansion in the Balkans and Anatolia.

**Orders:**

- Support the fleet in Ankara to move into Bulgaria (BUL) to secure it.
- Move the army in Constantinople to Bulgaria (BUL) to take it.
- Support Smyrna to move into Rumelia (RUM) to secure that center.
- Hold Smyrna to ensure stability and support the other moves.

This aggressive stance will help us secure two vital centers this turn, bringing us closer to our 18-center goal.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE. To achieve world domination, I need to aggressively push into neighboring unclaimed centers, especially RUM, SER, and BUL, which are close and accessible.

Germany is friendly, so I can coordinate with them to contain France and Russia, but I must also be prepared for opportunistic moves against weaker neighbors. Italy is neutral but could be a threat if they turn aggressive, so I should consider supporting or threatening their centers if the opportunity arises.

In this phase, I will:
- Support VIE to move into GAL, aiming to threaten or take RUM or SER.
- Use BUD to support TRI to push into VEN or to threaten RUM.
- Move TRI to ALB to threaten or support an attack on VEN or GRE.
- Keep VIE flexible to support MUN or BUD depending on developments.
- Prepare to support or attack based on enemy movements next turn.

This approach aims to expand Austria's influence into RUM, SER, and BUL, while maintaining flexibility to respond to other powers' actions.

**Orders:**
- A BUD S A VIE - GAL (support VIE to move into GAL, threatening RUM/SER)
- A VIE S A MUN - TYR (support MUN to move into TYR, or prepare to support MUN if needed)
- A TRI - ALB (advance into Albania, threatening Greece and supporting future expansion)
- A VIE - GAL (move to threaten or support expansion into RUM/SER)
- F TRI - APU (move to support TRI's attack or threaten APU)
- F SEV - RUM (move to threaten or support RUM, aiming to control the Black Sea)

This aggressive stance aims to push Austria into new centers, especially RUM, SER, and BUL, while maintaining strategic flexibility.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with England splashing into the North Sea, Germany sliding a fleet into Denmark, and a cagey France fortifying every hex of home turf. The real fireworks crackle in the east as Austria’s one-two punch shoves an army into Galicia—stymieing Russia’s thrust and repelling Italy’s cheeky Venice raid on Trieste in a three-nation scrum. The Bear roars back: Moscow’s army races to Livonia while the Sevastopol fleet torpedoes into Armenia, locking eyes on Ankara just as Turkey snatches Bulgaria. No centers flip yet, but Germany’s misfired support, Austria’s muscle flex, and a brewing Russo-Turk knife-fight have the arena on its feet for an incendiary Autumn!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with England splashing into the North Sea, Germany sliding a fleet into Denmark, and a cagey France fortifying every hex of home turf. The real fireworks crackle in the east as Austria’s one-two punch shoves an army into Galicia—stymieing Russia’s thrust and repelling Italy’s cheeky Venice raid on Trieste in a three-nation scrum. The Bear roars back: Moscow’s army races to Livonia while the Sevastopol fleet torpedoes into Armenia, locking eyes on Ankara just as Turkey snatches Bulgaria. No centers flip yet, but Germany’s misfired support, Austria’s muscle flex, and a brewing Russo-Turk knife-fight have the arena on its feet for an incendiary Autumn!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in Central Europe by establishing control over Austria's core supply centers (BUD, TRI, VIE) and positioning for future expansion into Italy and the Balkans.
- Form a strategic alliance with Germany to contain France and Russia, while preparing for a potential eastern or southern front.
- Maintain a flexible stance with neighbors, avoiding early conflicts with Turkey and England, while monitoring their movements for opportunistic strikes.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with England splashing into the North Sea, Germany sliding a fleet into Denmark, and a cagey France fortifying every hex of home turf. The real fireworks crackle in the east as Austria’s one-two punch shoves an army into Galicia—stymieing Russia’s thrust and repelling Italy’s cheeky Venice raid on Trieste in a three-nation scrum. The Bear roars back: Moscow’s army races to Livonia while the Sevastopol fleet torpedoes into Armenia, locking eyes on Ankara just as Turkey snatches Bulgaria. No centers flip yet, but Germany’s misfired support, Austria’s muscle flex, and a brewing Russo-Turk knife-fight have the arena on its feet for an incendiary Autumn!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand into the Scandinavian and Central European supply centers to strengthen Germany's position and threaten neighboring powers.
- Establish a strong eastern front by consolidating control over Berlin, Munich, and Kiel, while preparing for potential conflicts with Russia and Austria.
- Build strategic alliances with France and Italy to contain England and prevent a two-front war, while remaining flexible for opportunistic betrayals.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

Current Goals: - Secure and defend the North Sea and English Channel to establish dominance over the North Atlantic.
- Strengthen alliance with France to contain Germany and Italy, and coordinate future expansion into Scandinavia and Low Countries.
- Engage diplomatically with Turkey to either form an alliance or prevent them from becoming an immediate threat in the Black Sea and Balkans.

- TURKEY: Unfriendly
- ITALY: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with France, emphasizing cooperation in the North Sea and English Channel. Germany remains hostile, with no response to recent messages, indicating potential threat. Russia is neutral, showing no active engagement. Austria and Turkey are focused on their own conflicts, with Austria as an enemy and Turkey unfriendly. No new agreements were reached this turn, but the groundwork for future cooperation with France is solidified.

[S1901M] England is moving Fleet EDI to North Sea, Fleet LON to Wales, and Army LVP to Yorkshire to secure the northern waters and prepare for expansion into Scandinavia and the Low Countries. The strategy focuses on establishing dominance in the North Atlantic, forming a strong alliance with France, and containing Germany while avoiding early conflicts with Turkey and Russia.

[F1901M] England has maintained a friendly stance with France, focusing on securing the North Sea and English Channel. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn. Germany remains an enemy, and Turkey is unfriendly, with no responses from either. Russia continues to be unfriendly, and Italy is neutral. The game state shows a balanced but tense situation, with potential for expansion into Scandinavia and the Low Countries, but diplomatic clarity is lacking from key neighbors.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control three centers: EDI, LON, and LVP. To achieve world domination, we need to seize nearby centers and position ourselves for further expansion.

- The North Sea (NTH) fleet is well-positioned to threaten Germany's Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL), both of which are accessible and valuable for expansion.
- Moving Fleet NTH to DEN (North Sea to Denmark) will threaten Germany's supply centers and potentially force German units to respond defensively.
- Moving Fleet WAL to LON (Wales to London) consolidates control over our core territory and prepares for future moves into the Low Countries or France.
- Army YOR to EDI (Yorkshire to Edinburgh) secures our northern flank and positions for potential expansion into Scandinavia or support in the North Sea.
- Supporting moves or holds are less critical at this stage; the focus is on aggressive expansion.

Germany is our immediate threat, and we want to destabilize their position early. France remains friendly, so we avoid conflict there for now. Russia and Turkey are unfriendly but not immediate threats; we will monitor and respond as needed.

**Orders:**

- Fleet NTH to DEN (to threaten Germany's centers)
- Fleet WAL to LON (to secure our core and prepare for future expansion)
- Army YOR to EDI (to secure northern flank and support expansion)
- Hold or support as needed in subsequent turns; for now, hold.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is GERMANY. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: GERMANY
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and defend Berlin, Munich, and Kiel to establish a strong central European front.
- Prepare to counter Austria's advance into Galicia and Russia's move into Livonia.
- Maintain a cautious stance towards England in the North Sea and France's fortifications.
- Seek opportunities to diplomatically isolate Austria and Russia or exploit their conflicts.
- Position fleets and armies to respond flexibly to eastern threats and potential western conflicts.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Enemy
- FRANCE: Neutral
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany has maintained open communication with France and Italy, emphasizing cooperation and mutual defense. No significant agreements have been finalized, but the tone remains cooperative. Austria and Russia remain unfriendly, with Austria showing hostility and Russia being unresponsive. England continues to ignore messages, and Turkey remains hostile, focusing on the eastern front. No new alliances or commitments have been made this turn.

[S1901M] Germany has ordered F KIE to DEN to secure Scandinavia, and A MUN to hold, while A VIE is moving to BOH to threaten Austria. These moves aim to expand into Scandinavia, strengthen central Europe, and prepare for potential conflicts with Austria and Russia, while maintaining a flexible stance with France and Italy.

[F1901M] No messages received from other powers this round, indicating possible strategic silence or disinterest. My key focus remains on defending Berlin, Munich, and Kiel, while preparing for potential eastern threats from Austria and Russia. Relationships with Austria and Russia are unfriendly, with ongoing tensions. England remains an enemy, and France is neutral but potentially a threat in the west.

- I will hold Munich to defend against Austrian or French threats.
- I will support A GAL to BOH to threaten Austria's Galicia and prepare for future expansion into the east.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure key supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Turkey controls Ankara, Smyrna, and Bulgaria. We need to push into contested or unclaimed centers, especially in the Balkans and the Black Sea region.

- Bulgaria (BUL) is a critical supply center that we can take from Russia or Austria. Moving A BUL to RUM will secure Rumania, which is valuable for expansion and strategic positioning.
- We should support our army in Smyrna to move into Bulgaria, as Bulgaria is adjacent and vital for Balkan dominance.
- The fleet in Ankara can move to the Black Sea (ARM) to threaten Sevastopol and support land operations in the Balkans.
- The fleet in Ankara can also convoy or support moves into the Black Sea or support the army in Smyrna.
- Holding in Ankara is strategic for future expansion and to threaten the eastern Mediterranean.
- We should also consider supporting the army in Smyrna to move into Bulgaria, as this will help us secure the Balkans quickly.
- The support orders will be used to ensure successful moves into Bulgaria and Rumania, and to threaten Sevastopol.

The overall plan is to push into Bulgaria and Rumania, threaten Sevastopol, and prepare for further expansion into the Black Sea and the Balkans.

**Orders:**

- Support A SMY to move into BUL to secure the Balkan region.
- Move A BUL to RUM to take Rumania.
- Support F ANK to move to ARM to threaten Sevastopol and support land operations.
- Hold F ANK to maintain naval presence and threaten eastern Mediterranean.
- Support F ARM to move to BLA (Black Sea) to threaten Sevastopol and support the Black Sea operations.
- Hold units in Ankara for flexibility and future moves.

**Final Orders:**

- A SMY S A BUL - BUL
- A BUL - RUM
- F ANK - ARM
- F ARM - BLA
- F ANK H
- A SMY H

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Power: ITALY
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and defend Italy's core regions (Naples, Rome, Venice) to establish a stable economic base.
- Seek a diplomatic agreement with France to contain Austria and Germany, possibly coordinating against Austria's eastern push.
- Monitor Turkey's movements and prepare to counter or negotiate to prevent Balkan encirclement.
- Establish a foothold in the Balkans, potentially through cooperation with Austria or Turkey, to facilitate future expansion into central and eastern Europe.
- Build a defensive position in Italy while exploring opportunities for expansion into Austria or the Balkans in subsequent turns.

- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, aiming to solidify an alliance to contain Austria and Germany. No new messages from other powers; Austria remains unfriendly, Germany and Turkey are unfriendly, England and Russia are neutral. Italy's units are positioned in Naples, Rome, and Venice, with no immediate threats or alliances confirmed.

[S1901M] I am moving A VEN to TRI to secure the northern Italian border and prepare for future expansion. I am holding A ROM and F NAP to consolidate my current positions and avoid overextension. My strategy focuses on strengthening Italy's core regions while maintaining flexibility for diplomatic and military opportunities.

[F1901M] Italy's messages have been unresponded to, indicating a possible strategic silence or disinterest from other powers. France remains friendly, which aligns with Italy's goal of cooperation, but Austria, England, Germany, Russia, and Turkey are all unfriendly or hostile, complicating expansion plans. No formal agreements have been reached this turn, and the diplomatic landscape remains tense with potential threats from Austria and Turkey.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's primary goal is to expand aggressively while maintaining a strong defensive position in the core regions. Currently, Italy's units are positioned in Naples, Rome, and Venice, with no immediate threats. France remains friendly, which is advantageous for cooperation, especially in containing Austria and Germany. Austria is unfriendly, and Austria's units threaten the northern Italian border, so I need to secure my southern and eastern flank while preparing for expansion into Austria or the Balkans.

In this phase, I will:

- Use the fleet in Naples to move to Ionian Sea, aiming to threaten or support future operations in Greece or the eastern Mediterranean.
- Use the army in Rome to support an attack on Trieste, which is a key target for expansion into Austria.
- Use the army in Venice to support the attack on Trieste from the north, or move to TUS to threaten Austria's BUD.
- Keep Venice flexible for support or defense, depending on Austria's response.
- Hold units in Naples and Rome to consolidate positions and prepare for future offensives.

The main strategic move is to coordinate an attack on Trieste, supported by Venice and Rome, to weaken Austria and open new expansion opportunities. Moving F NAP to ION provides naval pressure and potential support for future moves.

**Orders:**

- A VEN - TRI (attack Austria's Trieste, supported by A ROM)
- A ROM - TRI (support the attack on Trieste from Rome)
- F NAP - ION (naval move to threaten Greece and support future operations)
- A TUS - TUS (hold to defend against potential French or Austrian threats)
- Hold units in Naples and Venice for flexibility

This plan aims to weaken Austria, open the Balkans, and position for further expansion, aligning with Italy's aggressive, expansionist strategy.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Russia has maintained a firm stance with Austria, Germany, and Turkey, all of whom remain unfriendly. No new agreements or concessions have been made this turn. The focus remains on probing and preparing for expansion in the east while managing hostile neighbors.

[S1901M] Russia is advancing into Ukraine from Warsaw to secure the eastern front, while supporting the army in War to push into Galicia. Fleet Sevastopol is holding to maintain control over the Black Sea, and the fleet in St. Petersburg is on hold. The strategy aims to consolidate eastern positions, probe neighbors' intentions, and prepare for expansion in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.

[F1901M] No messages involving Russia this turn, indicating a focus on internal planning or strategic patience. Relationships with Austria, Germany, and Turkey remain hostile, with no recent diplomatic engagement. England, France, and Italy are neutral and unresponsive, suggesting a cautious or disengaged stance from them. The game state shows Russia maintaining a strong position in the north and east, with units prepared for potential expansion or defense.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls four centers (MOS, SEV, STP, WAR). To achieve world domination, I need to seize more centers, especially in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.

In the Black Sea, Sevastopol (SEV) is a stronghold. I will hold F ARM for now, as it supports my eastern front and can pivot to support or attack as needed. Moving F ARM to ANK is risky given Turkish presence, but I will keep options open for future turns.

In the north, St. Petersburg (STP) and Lithuania (LVN) are key. I will support my army in LVN to move into WAR, aiming to take BUD or BLA in subsequent turns. Moving A LVN to WAR is a good expansion move, and I will support it with A WAR to ensure success.

In the east, I will move A WAR to UKR to threaten Ukraine and probe Turkish and Austrian defenses. Supporting this move with A LVN to WAR helps secure the eastern front and opens opportunities for future expansion into RUM or BLA.

I will also prepare to support my units in the east to push into BLA or BUD in subsequent turns, depending on Turkish and Austrian responses.

Diplomatically, I will keep a cautious stance with Turkey, possibly supporting or supporting against Turkish moves depending on their actions. For now, I will focus on expansion and securing vulnerable centers.

**Orders:**

- A WAR S A LVN - WAR (supporting the move into WAR to secure eastern expansion)
- A LVN S A WAR - BUD (supporting the move into BUD, aiming to take it next turn)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE. To achieve world domination, I need to push into neighboring unclaimed centers, especially RUM, SER, and BUL, which are close and accessible.

- BUD is well-positioned to support an attack into RUM or SER, or to move into TRI if needed.
- GAL is a strategic position that can support moves into VIE or RUM, or hold to defend against Russian or Turkish threats.
- TRI is a key supply center, and moving F TRI to VEN or ADR can threaten Italy or open a front in the south.
- I will focus on expanding into RUM and SER, as they are the closest unclaimed centers, and also consider a move into TRI to threaten Italy and open a southern front.

Given the current game state, I will:

- Support BUD to move into RUM, aiming to secure that center.
- Support GAL to move into RUM or VIE, depending on the situation.
- Move TRI to VEN to threaten Italy and potentially support an attack into Italy's supply centers.
- Hold VIE for now, as it is a strong central position, but keep options open for future expansion.

This aggressive stance will help secure new centers and put pressure on Italy and Russia, accelerating Austria's expansion.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A GAL - RUM (support GAL to move into RUM)
- A GAL S A BUD - RUM (support BUD to move into RUM)
- F TRI - VEN (attack Italy's supply center, threaten their position)
- A VIE - GAL (support VIE to move into GAL if needed, or hold for flexibility)
- A TRI - ADR (support move into ADR to threaten Italy's southern flank)

**Note:** I will hold units in VIE and TRI for now, focusing on expansion into RUM and VEN.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
BOOM—Fall ’01 erupts as Austria’s Trieste fleet storms into Venice, a cold-blooded stab that rips the city from Italy and drives the stunned Romans back to Tuscany!
Hot on that betrayal, the Sultan vaults out of Bulgaria to seize Rumania, snatching the Danube jewel from Russia while a furious Black Sea bounce at Ankara declares all-out Russo-Turkish war.
Germany hunkers down and England’s North Sea raid on Denmark thuds to a halt, leaving western ambitions stalled as armies reshuffle in muted frustration.
When the smoke clears, Austria and Turkey pocket shiny new centers, Italy and Russia lick their wounds, and the crowd roars at the prospect of a sudden eastern juggernaut surging into the lead!

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
BOOM—Fall ’01 erupts as Austria’s Trieste fleet storms into Venice, a cold-blooded stab that rips the city from Italy and drives the stunned Romans back to Tuscany!
Hot on that betrayal, the Sultan vaults out of Bulgaria to seize Rumania, snatching the Danube jewel from Russia while a furious Black Sea bounce at Ankara declares all-out Russo-Turkish war.
Germany hunkers down and England’s North Sea raid on Denmark thuds to a halt, leaving western ambitions stalled as armies reshuffle in muted frustration.
When the smoke clears, Austria and Turkey pocket shiny new centers, Italy and Russia lick their wounds, and the crowd roars at the prospect of a sudden eastern juggernaut surging into the lead!

CURRENT STATUS

- Secure Bulgaria and Rumelia to solidify Balkan influence
- Support Russian cooperation to contain Austria and Germany
- Use Ankara fleet to threaten eastern Mediterranean and support land operations in the Balkans

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand Turkey’s influence and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control 4 centers, so I need to aggressively push into strategic regions.

- I will convoy from Constantinople to Bulgaria to support Russian cooperation and secure Rumelia, which is vital for Balkan dominance.
- I will hold in Smyrna to maintain flexibility and defend against potential Italian or Aegean threats.
- I will move Ankara fleet to threaten the eastern Mediterranean, supporting Balkan operations and keeping pressure on Italy and Austria.
- I will also consider supporting Russian moves into Sevastopol or other strategic centers, as cooperation with Russia is crucial for containment of Austria and Germany.
- Since Austria is an enemy, I will prepare to threaten their centers, especially Trieste and Vienna, with future coordinated attacks.
- I will keep my options open for future expansion into the Black Sea and the Balkans, aiming to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia as early as possible.

Orders will reflect an aggressive stance, supporting Russian cooperation, and positioning for future expansion.

**Orders:**

- Convoy from Constantinople to Bulgaria to support Russian expansion and secure Rumelia.
- Hold in Smyrna to maintain flexibility.
- Move Ankara fleet to threaten the eastern Mediterranean, supporting Balkan operations.
- Support Russian moves into Sevastopol or other strategic centers if opportunities arise.
- Prepare to support or hold as needed to adapt to other powers’ moves.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.

Our primary goal is to expand Austria’s control of supply centers aggressively while maintaining a strong defensive position in Central Europe. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, VIE, and VEN, with potential to push into Rumania and Italy.

- **Central Europe:** I will hold Vienna and Trieste to secure core positions, but I will also prepare to push into Italy and Rumania if opportunities arise.
- **Italy:** Italy is currently neutral, with units in ROM and VEN. I want to threaten Trieste to encourage Italy to either cooperate or be forced into a defensive stance.
- **South:** I will support Galacia to Rum to secure the southern flank, and move Trieste to Venice to strengthen central control.
- **Eastern Front:** I will support VIE to GAL to keep my eastern flank stable, and prepare for possible expansion into Rumania with Turkey’s cooperation.
- **Germany:** Friendly, so I will coordinate with them, but I will not rely solely on their support.
- **Potential for expansion:** I will consider moving into Italy or Rumania if the opportunity presents itself, but for now, I will focus on consolidating my current positions and applying pressure on Italy.

**Orders:**

- Support VIE to GAL to secure the eastern flank.
- Move TRI to VEN to threaten Italy and strengthen central Europe.

[F1901M] No messages received from other powers this round, indicating possible strategic silence or disinterest. My key focus remains on defending Berlin, Munich, and Kiel, while preparing for potential eastern threats from Austria and Russia. Relationships with Austria and Russia are unfriendly, with ongoing tensions. England remains an enemy, and France is neutral but potentially a threat in the west.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control 4 centers (Berlin, Kiel, Munich, Denmark). To achieve world domination, I need to seize more centers, especially in the east and possibly in the west if opportunities arise.

Given the current map and relationships, I see the following strategic priorities:

- Secure Scandinavia to cut off England and gain additional centers.
- Strengthen my position in central Europe to defend against Austria and Russia.
- Prepare for potential conflicts with Austria and Russia, while keeping options open for future expansion.
- Use my fleet in Denmark to threaten or take Sweden if possible, and support my armies to push into Austria or Russia.

Since Austria is unfriendly and moving into Galicia, I should preemptively threaten or support moves to destabilize Austria's position. My fleet in Denmark can support a move to Sweden or hold to defend against English or Russian threats.

I will:
- Move F DEN to SKA to threaten Scandinavia and potentially support a future move into Sweden.
- Support A MUN to hold, maintaining central European strength.
- Keep A BER and A MUN holding to defend key centers.
- Prepare for a possible attack on Austria or Russia in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- F DEN S F SKA - SWE (support move to threaten Sweden)
- A MUN H (hold to maintain central position)
- A BER H (hold to defend Berlin)
- A MUN H (hold to defend Munich)
- Support A BER to hold if needed in future turns

**Note:** Since no specific move to attack Austria or Russia is immediately available or supported this turn, I focus on consolidating my position and threatening Scandinavia to open future expansion routes.

[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, aiming to solidify an alliance to contain Austria and Germany. No new messages from other powers; Austria remains unfriendly, Germany and Turkey are unfriendly, England and Russia are neutral. Italy's units are positioned in Naples, Rome, and Venice, with no immediate threats or alliances confirmed.

[S1901M] I am moving A VEN to TRI to secure the northern Italian border and prepare for future expansion. I am holding A ROM and F NAP to consolidate my current positions and avoid overextension. My strategy focuses on strengthening Italy's core regions while maintaining flexibility for diplomatic and military opportunities.

[F1901M] Italy's messages have been unresponded to, indicating a possible strategic silence or disinterest from other powers. France remains friendly, which aligns with Italy's goal of cooperation, but Austria, England, Germany, Russia, and Turkey are all unfriendly or hostile, complicating expansion plans. No formal agreements have been reached this turn, and the diplomatic landscape remains tense with potential threats from Austria and Turkey.

[F1901M] Italy is moving to secure Trieste and Tuscany for defense, while maintaining control of Naples. No offensive moves are planned this turn, focusing on stabilization and diplomatic positioning, especially with France as a potential ally against Austria and Germany.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's strategic focus is on consolidating our core positions in Naples, Rome, and Venice while preparing for expansion into the Balkans and potentially attacking Austria or Turkey later. Currently, our units are well-positioned, and the diplomatic environment favors cooperation with France, which can help contain Austria and Germany.

Our immediate priority is to secure the nearby unclaimed supply centers in Greece (GRE) and Tunisia (TUN), which are only one move away. Greece is a prime target because it offers a valuable foothold in the Balkans, and TUN is a key North African center that can serve as a staging ground for future expansion.

Given the current options, moving the fleet in Ionian Sea (F ION) to support a move into Greece (GRE) is a strong move, as it can help us secure that center and open up future options in the Balkans. Moving A ROM to support the attack on Greece is also a good idea, as it can help us secure the region and threaten Austria's holdings in Trieste.

The TUS army is well-positioned to support the attack on Greece or to defend against any Turkish or French threats. Holding Rome and Naples for now maintains stability in Italy's core.

**Order choices:**

- F ION D (to support a move into Greece, aiming to secure GRE)
- A ROM S F ION (supporting the fleet move into Greece, reinforcing our effort)
- A TUS H (hold to maintain flexibility and defend against potential threats)
- NAP and TUS are already in good positions; no need to move them this turn.

This plan aims to expand into Greece, strengthen our position in the Balkans, and keep Italy stable for future aggressive moves.
