intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany has maintained a proactive stance, with units positioned to support both defensive and offensive operations. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn, but the focus remains on consolidating core centers and preparing for expansion. Relationships with Austria and Turkey are unfriendly, with Austria being hostile and Turkey unfriendly, while relations with France, Russia, and Italy remain neutral. England continues to be an enemy, and no direct negotiations have been initiated with them this turn.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Germany controls BER, KIE, and MUN. Our immediate focus should be on expanding into neighboring neutral centers and weakening potential enemies, especially Russia and Austria, given their hostility.

- KIE is a key fleet position that can support moves into Denmark (DEN) and the Low Countries (HOL), both of which are accessible and valuable for expansion.
- MUN can support an attack into Belgium (BEL) or help secure the western flank.
- BER is a stronghold, but we should consider moving it to support KIE or MUN, or even attempt a surprise move into Denmark or the Low Countries.
- Our fleet in KIE can move to DEN or HOL to threaten or seize those centers.
- Our army in MUN can support a move into Belgium or prepare to support an attack into the Low Countries.
- We should also consider supporting our units to hold key positions while preparing for future offensives.

Given the current map and the phase, I will:

- Support MUN to move into BEL, aiming to take Belgium next turn.
- Use KIE to move to DEN to threaten Denmark and open expansion routes.
- Hold BER for now, but keep it flexible.
- Prepare to support or hold units to maximize expansion potential.

**Orders:**

- A MUN - BEL (to take Belgium next turn)
- F KIE - DEN (to threaten Denmark and open expansion routes)
- A BER H (hold for now, flexible)
- F HEL H (hold Heligoland Bight for naval control)
- Support moves to bolster MUN or KIE as needed in future turns.

**Final Orders:**

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Italy to secure additional supply centers. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with potential to push into RUM, SER, and possibly further into Greece or the Ottoman territories.

Given the game state, I will focus on consolidating my position in the Balkans and Italy, while preparing to seize RUM and SER, which are close and unclaimed. The units are well-positioned to support each other, and I want to avoid unnecessary conflicts with Italy or Turkey at this stage, maintaining a neutral stance with them.

- I will move A BUD to GAL to threaten Russia's access to the Balkans and open a front against the east.
- I will support A WAR to RUM to secure RUM, a key strategic center, and threaten the Russian flank.
- I will move A VIE to BUD to reinforce my core centers and prepare for future expansion.
- I will support F TRI to VEN to threaten Italy's supply center and potentially force a conflict or gain control.
- I will hold F TRI to maintain flexibility and support my armies.

This approach aims to expand my influence in the Balkans and Italy, threaten Russia and Italy, and set up for future aggressive moves.

**Orders:**

- A BUD - GAL
- A WAR S A RUS - RUM
- A VIE - BUD
- F TRI S A VEN
- F TRI - VEN

**Note:** I am supporting F TRI to VEN to threaten Italy's supply center, and I am supporting A WAR to RUM to secure that critical center. Moving A VIE to BUD consolidates my core, and A BUD to GAL opens a new front against Russia.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the North Sea and English Channel, leveraging our friendly relations with France to contain Germany and Italy, while positioning for future expansion into Scandinavia and the Baltic.

- The immediate focus is to secure the North Sea and English Channel, which are critical for controlling key supply centers and for launching future attacks.
- Moving F EDI to NTH is a strong opening move to threaten Germany’s Kiel and potentially cut off their expansion.
- Supporting F LON to YOR helps secure our western flank and prepares for a possible move into the North Sea or support for future attacks.
- Holding LVP and YOR for now maintains flexibility and keeps options open for future expansion.
- We should also monitor Germany’s moves closely, especially their fleet in KIE, and be ready to support or counterattack as needed.
- Our alliance with France is crucial; we should keep communication open to coordinate against Germany and Italy.
- Avoid unnecessary conflicts with Russia and Turkey for now, but stay alert for opportunities to expand into Scandinavia or the Baltic.

**Order choices:**

- F EDI → NTH to threaten Germany and prepare for future expansion.
- F LON → YOR to support expansion or defend.
- A LVP → YOR to reinforce our southern flank and keep options open.
- Hold units in the other territories for flexibility.

**Orders:**

- F EDI - NTH
- F LON - YOR
- A LVP - YOR
- F NWG H (Hold for now, to avoid overextension and keep options open)

Phase: S1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and expand in Italy's core regions: consolidate control of NAP, ROM, and VEN to strengthen our position and prepare for future expansion.
- Establish a strategic alliance with France and Austria to contain potential threats from Germany and Russia, while focusing on gaining control of key central and southern Europe supply centers.
- Initiate early negotiations with Turkey to either secure a non-aggression pact or plan a coordinated move against common neighbors, balancing the threat from the Ottoman Empire.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly relationship with France, which is beneficial for a coordinated approach in Western Europe. Austria remains unfriendly, posing a threat to Italy's eastern flank. Germany and Russia are enemies, with Germany showing aggressive posturing. Turkey is unfriendly, complicating southern diplomacy. No new agreements have been solidified this turn, but Italy's focus remains on consolidating control of NAP, ROM, and VEN while fostering alliances with France and Austria. The silence from some powers suggests a cautious or strategic withholding of commitments.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Italy controls NAP, ROM, and VEN. To achieve world domination, we need to seize new centers, especially in the east and south, while maintaining a strong defensive posture in the west.

- NAP is a key starting point; moving into Tunis (TUN) is critical for expansion in North Africa, which is a valuable supply center.
- Our fleet in NAP can support a move to TYS or APU, but TYS is more immediate and less contested.
- The units in ROM and VEN are well-positioned to support an attack on Trieste (TRI), which is controlled by Austria. Securing TRI will give us a vital eastern foothold.
- Austria is unfriendly and unfocused on our immediate interests, so aggressive moves against TRI and BUD are justified.
- Our fleet in NAP should move to TYS to threaten the Tyrrhenian Sea, supporting the attack on TRI or threatening France.
- The army in VEN can move to TRI, supported by the fleet in ION, to quickly take TRI from Austria.
- The army in ROM can hold to defend our core, but if the opportunity arises, supporting the attack on TRI is preferable.
- The fleet in ION can support the move to TRI or hold to defend against French or Austrian threats.

This plan aims to secure TRI, threaten Tunis, and position for future expansion into Greece and the Balkans, pushing us closer to 18 centers.

---

**Orders:**

- The fleet in NAP moves to TYS to threaten the Tyrrhenian Sea and support future operations.
- The army in VEN moves to TRI, supported by the fleet in ION, to take Austria's key eastern center.
- The army in ROM holds to defend our core.
- The fleet in ION supports the move from VEN to TRI, ensuring success.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls 4 centers (MOS, SEV, STP, WAR). We need to seize nearby vulnerable centers and threaten our enemies, especially Austria, Turkey, and potentially Germany, to maximize our gains.

- **MOS**: We can support a move to Ukraine (UKR) to threaten Austria and potentially gain a new center. Moving A MOS - UKR is a bold move, aiming to threaten Austria's flank and open up new expansion opportunities.
- **SEV**: We should support the move F SEV S A BUD to threaten Austria's BUD and potentially take it if Austria is overextended.
- **WAR**: Moving A WAR - LVN is a strong move to threaten the Baltic and cut off Germany's access to the east, while also threatening to expand into the Baltic region.
- **Support and Flexibility**: Holding units in Sevastopol and Moscow to maintain pressure and flexibility for future turns.

This aggressive stance aims to threaten Austria's centers (BUD, TRI), expand into Ukraine, and threaten the Baltic, all while maintaining a strong position in the Black Sea and the east.

**Order choices:**

- A MOS S A UKR (support move to threaten Ukraine)
- F SEV S A BUD (support move to threaten BUD)
- A WAR S A LVN (support move to threaten the Baltic)
- A WAR - LVN (direct move to threaten the Baltic)
- F SEV - ARM (to threaten Turkey and secure Black Sea influence)
- A MOS - UKR (to threaten Ukraine and pressure Austria)

**Note:** Support moves are chosen to maximize pressure on Austria and Turkey, while aggressive moves aim to expand our control.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia, leveraging our position to threaten Austria and Italy, and to secure key supply centers. Russia remains friendly, which is advantageous for future cooperation, but we must be cautious of Austria, Italy, and France, who are all unfriendly.

Currently, our units are positioned defensively but with potential for expansion:

- F ANK controls the coast and can threaten the Black Sea or support moves into the Balkans.
- A CON controls the coast and can support or move into Bulgaria or threaten Greece.
- A SMY is well-placed to support or attack in the region, potentially moving into Greece or supporting CON.

Our immediate focus should be:

1. Secure and expand in the Balkans by moving A CON into Bulgaria (BUL) to threaten RUM and ROU, and possibly support F ANK into Bulgaria if needed.
2. Use F ANK to threaten or support moves into the Black Sea or support A SMY into Greece (SYR) to threaten Italy or Austria.
3. Consider supporting A SMY into Greece (SYR) to threaten Italy's southern flank and open expansion routes.
4. Keep options open for future moves into uncontrolled centers like BUL and RUM, and prepare to threaten Austria's supply centers.

Given the current orders, I will:

- Support A SMY into SYR to threaten Greece and open expansion options.
- Support F ANK into BUL to threaten the Black Sea and Bulgaria.
- Hold A CON for now, but keep it ready to support or move into Bulgaria or Greece depending on developments.

This aggressive stance aims to threaten multiple fronts, destabilize Austria and Italy, and position Turkey for further expansion.

---

**Orders:**

- Support A SMY S F SEV - ARM (to threaten Greece and support expansion)
- Support F ANK S A SMY - SYR (to threaten Greece and support A SMY)
- Hold A CON (to keep flexibility for future moves)

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
The opening whistle screams and the board explodes: Russia and Turkey unveil a classic Juggernaut as Sevastopol’s fleet, boosted by Smyrna’s support, rockets into Armenia—aimed straight at Austria’s soft underbelly. Vienna and Budapest trade places while Austria lunges into Galicia, only to watch its Trieste fleet smash into a Venetian wall, confirming an Italo-Austrian knife-fight. Germany shocks the gallery by sprinting Munich into Bohemia and parking Kiel’s fleet in Denmark, all while England seizes the strategic North Sea, foreshadowing a northern powder keg. France coolly fortifies its trio and Italy anchors the Tyrrhenian, ending Spring with zero center swings but alliances flashing neon-bright and every front poised to detonate in the fall.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
The opening whistle screams and the board explodes: Russia and Turkey unveil a classic Juggernaut as Sevastopol’s fleet, boosted by Smyrna’s support, rockets into Armenia—aimed straight at Austria’s soft underbelly. Vienna and Budapest trade places while Austria lunges into Galicia, only to watch its Trieste fleet smash into a Venetian wall, confirming an Italo-Austrian knife-fight. Germany shocks the gallery by sprinting Munich into Bohemia and parking Kiel’s fleet in Denmark, all while England seizes the strategic North Sea, foreshadowing a northern powder keg. France coolly fortifies its trio and Italy anchors the Tyrrhenian, ending Spring with zero center swings but alliances flashing neon-bright and every front poised to detonate in the fall.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in the Balkans and Anatolia to establish a strong foothold and threaten neighboring powers.
- Form a strategic alliance with Russia to contain Austria and Germany, while preparing for potential conflicts with France and England.
- Leverage Turkey's position to threaten Italy and Austria, aiming to control key supply centers and facilitate future expansion into Central Europe and the Mediterranean.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
The opening whistle screams and the board explodes: Russia and Turkey unveil a classic Juggernaut as Sevastopol’s fleet, boosted by Smyrna’s support, rockets into Armenia—aimed straight at Austria’s soft underbelly. Vienna and Budapest trade places while Austria lunges into Galicia, only to watch its Trieste fleet smash into a Venetian wall, confirming an Italo-Austrian knife-fight. Germany shocks the gallery by sprinting Munich into Bohemia and parking Kiel’s fleet in Denmark, all while England seizes the strategic North Sea, foreshadowing a northern powder keg. France coolly fortifies its trio and Italy anchors the Tyrrhenian, ending Spring with zero center swings but alliances flashing neon-bright and every front poised to detonate in the fall.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in Italy's core regions: consolidate control of NAP, ROM, and VEN to strengthen our position and prepare for future expansion.
- Establish a strategic alliance with France and Austria to contain potential threats from Germany and Russia, while focusing on gaining control of key central and southern Europe supply centers.
- Initiate early negotiations with Turkey to either secure a non-aggression pact or plan a coordinated move against common neighbors, balancing the threat from the Ottoman Empire.

- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)

{""negotiation_summary"": ""France continues to ignore my alliance proposals regarding Belgium and the Channel, having not responded to messages in the last two phases.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly relationship with France, which is beneficial for a coordinated approach in Western Europe. Austria remains unfriendly, posing a threat to Italy's eastern flank. Germany and Russia are enemies, with Germany showing aggressive posturing. Turkey is unfriendly, complicating southern diplomacy. No new agreements have been solidified this turn, but Italy's focus remains on consolidating control of NAP, ROM, and VEN while fostering alliances with France and Austria. The silence from some powers suggests a cautious or strategic withholding of commitments.

[S1901M] Moved NAP to TYS to threaten Tyrolia, ordered VEN to TRI to support expansion in the north, and held ROM to consolidate Italy's core. Aiming to strengthen position in Italy, build alliances with France and Austria, and prepare for future expansion while managing threats from Germany, Russia, and Turkey.

[F1901M] Italy maintains a strong core with NAP, ROM, and VEN, and has established friendly relations with France. No new agreements have been made this turn, but Italy's diplomatic stance remains proactive. Austria is unfriendly, and Germany and Russia are enemies, with Turkey also unfriendly. Italy's messages have been responsive, but some powers, notably Austria and Turkey, remain unresponsive or hostile.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's primary focus this turn is to secure and expand from our core centers—Naples, Rome, and Venice—while maintaining a defensive posture against Austria, France, and Germany. Our current position is strong, with NAP, ROM, and VEN controlled, and we have friendly relations with France, which we should leverage for a coordinated expansion into the west.

Given the map and possible moves, I see an opportunity to push into Trieste from Venice, supported by our fleet in TYS and army in VEN. This will threaten Austria's key supply center and potentially force them to respond defensively, opening up further expansion opportunities.

Our fleet in TYS can support the attack on Trieste, and our army in ROM can either hold or support the attack if needed. The army in ROM is well-positioned to defend against any Austrian counterattack or to pivot toward other centers if Austria is overextended.

We should also prepare for potential French or German moves by positioning fleets and armies to defend our core and threaten their supply centers if opportunities arise.

**Key moves:**
- Attack Trieste from VEN supported by TYS.
- Hold ROM to defend against Austrian counterattack.
- Keep NAP and VEN secure, and prepare to push into BUD or BOL if Austria weakens.

**Orders:**
- A VEN - TRI (attack Austria's Trieste, supported by F TYS)
- A APU S A VEN - TRI (support the attack from Apulia)
- F TYS S A VEN - TRI (support the attack from the sea)
- A ROM H (hold Rome for now)
- F NAP - TYS (prepare to support or defend, and threaten Austria's southern flank)

This aggressive move aims to weaken Austria early, gain a strategic foothold in the east, and set the stage for further expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Russia, securing their support or neutrality in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. No new agreements with other powers; Austria, England, France, Germany, and Italy remain unfriendly or unresponsive. Turkey's units are positioned defensively in Ankara, Smyrna, and Constance, with potential for expansion into the Balkans and Mediterranean.

[S1901M] I ordered A SMY to support SEV to ARM, while holding A CON and F ANK to maintain position. My strategic focus remains on consolidating control in Anatolia and the Balkans, strengthening alliances with Russia, and preparing for future expansion against neighboring powers.

[F1901M] Maintained strong alliance with Russia, focusing on consolidating positions in Armenia and Smyrna, while keeping Austria as an enemy. No new agreements with other powers this turn. Austria remains hostile, and other powers are unresponsive or unfriendly, limiting diplomatic options. No direct negotiations with England, France, or Germany this round.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Mediterranean, leveraging our alliance with Russia to secure Armenia and Sevastopol, while pressing Austria and Italy for territorial gains. Given the current positions, I want to:

- Secure Smyrna and Constantinople to consolidate control over Anatolia.
- Use Smyrna to threaten Greece and potentially push into Bulgaria or support Russia.
- Support Armenia from Smyrna and Ankara to strengthen our eastern front.
- Consider a move into Bulgaria (BUL) from Constantinople if the opportunity arises, or prepare to support Russia's expansion.
- Maintain flexibility to support or hold units depending on enemy moves.

Since Austria is enemy and unfriendly, I will avoid overextending into their territory directly this turn but will position units to threaten their supply centers in Trieste and Greece in subsequent turns.

The units are positioned well for a defensive stance with potential for expansion. I will:

- Order F ANK to support Smyrna to Constantinople, reinforcing our hold.
- Move A SMY to support A CON to hold or threaten Greece.
- Support A CON to hold or prepare to move into Bulgaria if the opportunity arises.
- Keep F ARM supporting F ANK to maintain control of Armenia.
- Hold A CON for now, but keep options open for future expansion.

**Orders:**

- F ANK S A SMY - CON (support Smyrna to Constantinople)
- A SMY S A CON - BUL (support move into Bulgaria if needed, or hold for now)
- A CON S A SMY - BUL (support move into Bulgaria)
- F ARM S F ANK (support F ANK to hold Armenia)
- A SMY H (hold Smyrna for now)

This setup maintains flexibility, supports our key positions, and prepares for future expansion into Greece, Bulgaria, and the Balkans.

[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, reinforcing the alliance and coordinating future moves. No new commitments from Austria, England, France, Italy, or Turkey; their responses remain neutral or unfriendly. No significant agreements reached this turn, but the groundwork for future cooperation is intact.

[S1901M] Russia orders Army WAR to move to LVN, Fleet SEV to move to ARM, Army MOS to move to UKR, and Fleet STP/SC to hold. The strategy aims to secure eastern centers, pressure Turkey, and maintain flexibility in the north, while strengthening alliances with Germany and preparing for potential conflicts in the south.

[F1901M] Russia maintains a proactive stance with a focus on securing the Black Sea and pressuring Austria and Turkey. No new agreements have been made this turn, but communication remains open. Relationships with Austria and Turkey are unfriendly, while England, France, Germany, and Italy are neutral. No responses from Austria, England, France, or Italy suggest a cautious or strategic silence, possibly to gauge Russian moves or avoid commitments.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls four centers: MOS, SEV, STP, WAR. We need to push into Turkey, Austria, and potentially further into Eastern Europe.

- The most immediate opportunity is to threaten Turkey's key centers: ANK, CON, and SMY. Our fleet in ARM can support a move to BLA (Black Sea), which is a strategic position to threaten Turkey and support future operations.
- Moving F ARM to BLA will threaten Turkey's supply centers and help us secure the Black Sea, which is critical for controlling the southeastern flank.
- Our armies in LVN and UKR are positioned to support or threaten Austria and further eastern expansion. Moving A LVN to WAR can threaten Austria's Galicia, and A UKR can support or threaten BUD or RUM.
- The support options for A UKR and A LVN allow flexibility to either support attacks or defend as needed.
- We should hold the units in STP/SC and WAR for now, maintaining flexibility.
- Our focus is on aggressive expansion, so I will move ARM to BLA, UKR to GAL, and LVN to WAR, supporting where possible.

**Orders:**

- F ARM S F ARM - BLA (support move to Black Sea, threaten Turkey)
- A UKR - GAL (advance into Austria's flank)
- A LVN - WAR (threaten Austria's Galicia)
- A UKR S A BUD - RUM (support move to threaten Rumania and pressure Austria)
- F STP/SC hold (maintain flexibility)

This setup aims to pressure Turkey, Austria, and secure eastern expansion, setting the stage for further aggressive moves next turn.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control only 3 centers, so we need to push into neutral and contested areas. France remains friendly, which is advantageous for coordinated expansion into Scandinavia and the Baltic. Germany is hostile, so we should avoid direct conflict with them for now but remain vigilant.

In the North, our fleet in London (F LON) and North Sea (F NTH) are well-positioned to threaten or support moves into Scandinavia and the Baltic. The units in London and North Sea can support or move into YOR, which is a strategic staging point for future expansion.

The LVP army (A LVP) is currently on YOR, and I will support it to YOR from LVP to prepare for expansion into Belgium or the Netherlands, which are key neutral centers. Moving LVP to YOR is a flexible move that can support future attacks or defend against German advances.

I will also move F LON to YOR to support the LVP army and prepare for future expansion into Belgium or the Netherlands. The fleet in North Sea (F NTH) will support the move from LON to YOR, or alternatively, move to HEL or support other moves as needed.

Since our goal is aggressive expansion, I will also prepare to support moves into Belgium (BEL) and the Netherlands (HOL) in subsequent turns, but for now, I will focus on positioning units for future attacks.

**Orders:**

- F LON S F NTH - YOR (support move to YOR, preparing for expansion)
- F NTH S F DEN - NTH (support move to NTH, maintaining control and pressure)
- A LVP S F LON - YOR (support move to YOR, positioning for expansion)
- A LVP S F NTH - YOR (support move from NTH to YOR, reinforcing)
- F NTH - HEL (move to support future expansion into Scandinavia)
- A LVP - YOR (move to YOR to prepare for future expansion into Belgium or Netherlands)

This setup positions us to push into Belgium and the Netherlands next turn, aiming to secure more centers and accelerate our path to 18.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to move toward domination. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with potential to expand into RUM, SER, and possibly further into the Balkans and Italy.

- BUD is a key starting point; moving into RUM or SER will help us gain more centers and threaten Russia and Turkey.
- Galacia (GAL) is a strategic position to support BUD or to threaten RUM and SER.
- Trieste (TRI) is a vital supply center, and with Italy's units nearby, we should consider supporting an attack to secure it.
- Vienna (VIE) is well-defended, but we should reinforce it if needed.

Given the current map and options, I will:

- Support BUD to move into RUM, gaining a crucial center and putting pressure on Russia.
- Support GAL to move into RUM, reinforcing the attack.
- Keep TRI supported to threaten Italy's control, possibly forcing Italy to divert units.
- Hold TRI for now, as Italy's units are nearby, and we want to avoid overextending.
- No moves into the sea or other fronts this turn, focusing on land expansion.

This plan aims to secure RUM and SER quickly, expand our influence in the Balkans, and set up for further expansion into Italy and the east.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A GAL - RUM (support GAL to move into RUM)
- A GAL S A BUD - RUM (support BUD to move into RUM)
- A TRI S A VEN - TRI (support VEN to attack TRI, or hold if no attack is planned)
- F TRI H (hold to defend TRI from Italian attack)
- A VIE H (hold Vienna for now, reinforcing the center)

This aggressive stance will help us secure RUM and SER, and prepare for further expansion next turn.

[S1901M] Germany has maintained a proactive stance, with units positioned to support both defensive and offensive operations. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn, but the focus remains on consolidating core centers and preparing for expansion. Relationships with Austria and Turkey are unfriendly, with Austria being hostile and Turkey unfriendly, while relations with France, Russia, and Italy remain neutral. England continues to be an enemy, and no direct negotiations have been initiated with them this turn.

[S1901M] Germany orders F KIE to DEN to secure Scandinavia, A MUN to BOH to threaten Austria and prepare for expansion, and A BER to hold position for defense and potential future support. The strategy focuses on consolidating core centers, establishing a foothold in Scandinavia, and maintaining flexibility for future alliances and offensives.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control Berlin, Kiel, and Munich. I need to push into Scandinavia and the Low Countries, as well as threaten Austria and Russia to weaken their positions.

- I will move my fleet from Kiel to Denmark to contest or take control of Denmark, which is a key strategic center for expansion into Scandinavia.
- My army in Berlin will support a move to Kiel to secure it further and prepare for future expansion.
- My army in Bohemia will move to Galicia to threaten Austria's eastern flank and potentially support future attacks or defend against Austrian counterattacks.
- My fleet in Denmark will support the move into the North Sea, threatening England and opening options for future expansion.
- I will hold my units in Munich and Ruhr for now, maintaining flexibility.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Denmark, threaten the Low Countries, and position myself for further expansion into Scandinavia and the north, while also keeping options open for future alliances or betrayals.

**Orders:**

- F KIE - DEN (to contest or take Denmark)
- A BER - KIE (support Kiel, or prepare for future moves)
- A BOH - GAL (threatening Austria, supporting expansion east)
- F DEN - NTH (support move into North Sea, threaten England)
- A MUN - SIL (support move to threaten Austria or defend Munich)
- A RUHR - HOL (aim to take or threaten Holland in future turns)

**Note:** Orders are based on the current possible moves and strategic goals, emphasizing expansion and pressure on neighbors.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Fall 1901 explodes as Russia muscles its way into the Black Sea, slamming the door on any Austro-Turkish cooperation and announcing an eastern power play. In the north, the waves churn: Germany storms into the North Sea while England slips into Helgoland Bight—an electrifying fleet swap that leaves both captains staring down the barrels of each other’s guns.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Fall 1901 explodes as Russia muscles its way into the Black Sea, slamming the door on any Austro-Turkish cooperation and announcing an eastern power play. In the north, the waves churn: Germany storms into the North Sea while England slips into Helgoland Bight—an electrifying fleet swap that leaves both captains staring down the barrels of each other’s guns. Italy’s stab at Trieste bounces off a braced Austrian fleet, and Germany’s Bohemian thrust ricochets in Galicia, signaling that the Central Powers’ honeymoon is already over. No centers change hands yet, but the battle lines are redrawn, tempers are fraying, and the momentum meter is screaming red as we barrel toward the crucial Winter builds!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and defend NAP, ROM, and VEN to maintain a strong core position.
- Establish a non-aggression or defensive pact with France and Austria to counter German and Russian threats.
- Initiate diplomatic talks with Turkey to explore a potential alliance or coordinated move against common enemies.
- Prepare to respond to German expansion by positioning fleets and armies for defense and potential counterattack.
- Monitor Russian and Turkish movements closely to avoid being caught in their juggernaut and to identify opportunities for expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Fall 1901 explodes as Russia muscles its way into the Black Sea, slamming the door on any Austro-Turkish cooperation and announcing an eastern power play. In the north, the waves churn: Germany storms into the North Sea while England slips into Helgoland Bight—an electrifying fleet swap that leaves both captains staring down the barrels of each other’s guns. Italy’s stab at Trieste bounces off a braced Austrian fleet, and Germany’s Bohemian thrust ricochets in Galicia, signaling that the Central Powers’ honeymoon is already over. No centers change hands yet, but the battle lines are redrawn, tempers are fraying, and the momentum meter is screaming red as we barrel toward the crucial Winter builds!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand control over the Balkans and Anatolia, especially consolidating positions in Armenia and Smyrna.
- Strengthen alliance with Russia and coordinate future moves to threaten Austria and Italy.
- Prepare to counter potential German or French aggression by fortifying key positions and maintaining flexible diplomacy.
- Exploit Austria's weakened state to seize strategic centers such as Trieste and Greece.
- Establish a foothold in the Mediterranean to facilitate future expansion into Italy and North Africa.
