atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

    ""initial_goals"": [
        ""Secure Sweden and Norway in the north while maintaining control of STP"",

        ""Work towards gaining Galicia and/or Rumania while preventing Austrian expansion eastward""

        ""GERMANY"": ""Neutral"",
        ""ITALY"": ""Neutral"",
        ""TURKEY"": ""Friendly""
    }
}

The assessment is based on Russia's starting position:

1. Austria is marked as ""Unfriendly"" due to the immediate tension over Galicia and potential competition for Balkans influence.

2. Turkey is marked as ""Friendly"" because:
   - Russia and Turkey can benefit from early cooperation
   - They have complementary expansion directions
   - A Juggernaut alliance is a strong opening strategy

3. Other powers are marked as ""Neutral"" because:
   - They are geographically distant enough to not pose immediate threats
   - There's potential for various alliance configurations
   - No immediate conflicts of interest exist

The goals focus on:
- Securing the northern expansion route (critical for Russian growth)
- Managing the southern front through diplomacy with Turkey
- Addressing the immediate threat from Austria while seeking expansion opportunities",Success: Applied LLM data

    ""initial_goals"": [
        ""Secure Norway and/or Belgium as neutral supply centers in 1901"",

        ""Negotiate with either France or Germany for an early alliance against the other""

        ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",
        ""TURKEY"": ""Neutral""
    }
}

The rationale for these assessments:

Initial Goals:
- Norway and Belgium are crucial neutral centers that England can reach early
- Control of the North Sea is vital for English naval supremacy and projection of power
- An early alliance with either France or Germany helps secure a flank while targeting the other

Relationships:
- France: Unfriendly due to natural competition in the English Channel and potential conflict over Belgium
- Germany: Neutral as potential for either alliance or conflict exists
- Russia: Unfriendly due to competition over Norway and northern waters
- Italy: Neutral as minimal early game interaction
- Austria: Neutral as minimal early game interaction
- Turkey: Neutral as minimal early game interaction",Success: Applied LLM data

  RUSSIA: Hello Austria. I believe we can avoid unnecessary conflict if we establish clear boundaries. What are your thoughts on Galicia? I'd prefer to keep it as a DMZ to prevent early tension between us.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  AUSTRIA: Greetings! I understand there might be some tension between us, but I believe we can find common ground. I propose a non-aggression pact for the initial phases to focus on our respective expansions. This could benefit both of us by avoiding unnecessary conflicts.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  AUSTRIA: Hello! I am reaching out to discuss the potential for cooperation in the Balkans. While we may have had unfriendly relations, I believe there is room for negotiation. I am interested in securing Serbia and Greece, and I am open to discussing how we can both benefit from a peaceful approach.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello! I am interested in discussing a potential alliance to secure our mutual interests in Eastern Europe. I plan to move towards Serbia and Greece, and I would appreciate your support or at least neutrality in these endeavors. Let's work together to ensure stability in the region.
  RUSSIA: Hello Austria. I believe we can avoid unnecessary conflict if we establish clear boundaries. What are your thoughts on Galicia? I'd prefer to keep it as a DMZ to prevent early tension between us.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: I notice you have both northern fleets deployed. I want to be direct - I plan to contest Norway. However, I'm open to discussing how we might avoid unnecessary conflict if you're willing to focus your expansion elsewhere.
  RUSSIA: Greetings England! I want to assure you that I have no aggressive intentions in Scandinavia. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves to ensure we both benefit from the northern expansion?

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Greetings! As we start our campaigns, I wanted to touch base regarding our mutual borders. I am planning to move my fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and I would appreciate your understanding in this matter. I have no aggressive intentions towards your territories this year. Perhaps we can discuss potential areas of cooperation in the future.
  RUSSIA: Hello Germany! I'm interested in establishing a peaceful northern border with you. Would you be open to discussing how we can avoid conflict in the Baltic region?

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: Greetings from England! I'm interested in discussing a potential alliance. Russia seems to be positioning aggressively with both northern fleets, which could threaten both our interests. Would you be open to a DMZ in the North Sea and coordinating our moves against Russia?
  GERMANY: Greetings! As we begin our campaigns, I propose a mutual understanding to ensure peace in the North Sea region. I am planning to move my fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and I would appreciate your support or at least non-interference. In return, I can assure you that I have no intentions towards the North Sea or your territories this year. Let's work together for mutual benefit.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: Hello France. I propose we establish a clear understanding early - I'm willing to stay out of the English Channel this turn if you'll do the same. This would allow us both to focus on more profitable expansion elsewhere. What are your thoughts?

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Hello France. I propose we establish a clear understanding early - I'm willing to stay out of the English Channel this turn if you'll do the same. This would allow us both to focus on more profitable expansion elsewhere. What are your thoughts?

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hello! I hope this message finds you well. I am interested in establishing a peaceful border between our nations. I plan to focus my efforts on securing Denmark and Holland, and I have no intentions of moving towards Burgundy or any of your territories. Let's consider a non-aggression pact for the coming year to strengthen our positions.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",

gpt-4o,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

  AUSTRIA: Greetings! As we both share a friendly relationship, I propose we coordinate our moves to ensure mutual growth. I plan to focus on securing the Balkans and would appreciate your support in maintaining peace between our borders. Let's keep communication open to avoid any misunderstandings.
  GERMANY: Hello, my friend! I hope all is well. As we begin our campaigns, I wanted to reaffirm our friendly relations. I am focusing my efforts in the north and have no intentions of moving towards your territories. Let's continue to support each other and keep our borders secure.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello! I am interested in discussing a potential alliance to secure our mutual interests in Eastern Europe. I plan to move towards Serbia and Greece, and I would appreciate your support or at least neutrality in these endeavors. Let's work together to ensure stability in the region.
  RUSSIA: Hello Austria. I believe we can avoid unnecessary conflict if we establish clear boundaries. What are your thoughts on Galicia? I'd prefer to keep it as a DMZ to prevent early tension between us.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  AUSTRIA: Greetings! I understand there might be some tension between us, but I believe we can find common ground. I propose a non-aggression pact for the initial phases to focus on our respective expansions. This could benefit both of us by avoiding unnecessary conflicts.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  AUSTRIA: Hello! I am reaching out to discuss the potential for cooperation in the Balkans. While we may have had unfriendly relations, I believe there is room for negotiation. I am interested in securing Serbia and Greece, and I am open to discussing how we can both benefit from a peaceful approach.
  TURKEY: Greetings from Turkey! I propose a non-aggression pact between our nations for the early game. We can focus on our respective expansions without interference. Let me know your thoughts.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Austria in Spring 1901, my primary goal is to secure the Balkans by capturing neutral supply centers such as Serbia and Greece. Additionally, I aim to establish a defensive position and maintain friendly relations with Germany and Russia. Given the current diplomatic landscape, I will focus on the following strategies:

1. **Secure Serbia:** Moving Army Budapest (A BUD) to Serbia (SER) is a straightforward move to secure a neutral supply center. This aligns with my goal of strengthening Austria's position in the Balkans.

2. **Position for Greece:** Moving Fleet Trieste (F TRI) to Albania (ALB) positions me to potentially capture Greece in the following turn. This move also avoids immediate conflict with Italy, as I have proposed a non-aggression pact.

3. **Defensive Positioning in Galicia:** Moving Army Vienna (A VIE) to Galicia (GAL) serves two purposes: it positions me to potentially move into Romania or support actions in the Balkans, and it acts as a defensive measure against any unexpected Russian aggression, despite the proposed DMZ.

These moves are designed to expand my influence in the Balkans while maintaining a defensive posture against potential threats from Italy and Russia.

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Germany in Spring 1901, my primary goal is to secure the neutral supply centers of Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) to strengthen my position in the north. This will provide a solid foundation for future expansion and ensure that I am not outpaced by neighboring powers.

1. **Fleet in Kiel (F KIE) to Denmark (DEN):** This move is crucial for securing Denmark, a key supply center that will bolster my naval presence and provide a strategic advantage in the north.

2. **Army in Berlin (A BER) to Kiel (KIE):** Moving the army to Kiel positions it to support future operations in the north, including potential moves into Denmark or Holland. It also ensures that Kiel remains secure.

3. **Army in Munich (A MUN) to Ruhr (RUH):** Moving to Ruhr positions the army to take Holland in the fall, while also providing flexibility to respond to any French aggression or to support operations in Belgium if needed.

These moves align with my strategic goals of proactive expansion and calculated aggression, while maintaining a defensive posture against potential threats from France and Russia.

claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

MESSAGES THIS ROUND
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 TURKEY: Greetings to all powers! Turkey is open to discussions and alliances that promote peace and mutual growth. Looking forward to a dynamic and engaging game with everyone.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello! I am interested in discussing a potential alliance to secure our mutual interests in Eastern Europe. I plan to move towards Serbia and Greece, and I would appreciate your support or at least neutrality in these endeavors. Let's work together to ensure stability in the region.
  RUSSIA: Hello Austria. I believe we can avoid unnecessary conflict if we establish clear boundaries. What are your thoughts on Galicia? I'd prefer to keep it as a DMZ to prevent early tension between us.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: I notice you have both northern fleets deployed. I want to be direct - I plan to contest Norway. However, I'm open to discussing how we might avoid unnecessary conflict if you're willing to focus your expansion elsewhere.
  RUSSIA: Greetings England! I want to assure you that I have no aggressive intentions in Scandinavia. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves to ensure we both benefit from the northern expansion?

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Greetings! As we start our campaigns, I wanted to touch base regarding our mutual borders. I am planning to move my fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and I would appreciate your understanding in this matter. I have no aggressive intentions towards your territories this year. Perhaps we can discuss potential areas of cooperation in the future.
  RUSSIA: Hello Germany! I'm interested in establishing a peaceful northern border with you. Would you be open to discussing how we can avoid conflict in the Baltic region?

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  RUSSIA: Greetings! I propose we establish a strong Russo-Turkish alliance. I suggest a DMZ in Black Sea and would be happy to support you into Armenia while I focus northward. What are your thoughts on working together against Austria?
  TURKEY: Dear Russia, I hope we can find a way to avoid conflict in the Black Sea. Perhaps we can agree on a DMZ there to focus on other areas. Looking forward to your response.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
1. Northern Strategy:
- Move F STP/SC to BOT to position for Sweden while maintaining flexibility
- A MOS to STP to secure the northern front and prepare for Norway
- This setup allows us to contest both Sweden and Norway effectively

2. Southern Strategy:
- Keep F SEV in place to honor Black Sea DMZ with Turkey
- This builds trust with Turkey while protecting against potential betrayal
- Position allows support into Rumania if needed

3. Central Strategy:
- Move A WAR to GAL to contest this crucial territory
- Galicia is vital for both defense and future expansion
- This move puts pressure on Austria while protecting against their expansion

The orders balance aggressive expansion with defensive positioning:
- Northern moves set up for guaranteed capture of Sweden
- Southern position maintains Turkish alliance while threatening Rumania
- Central move contests Galicia while protecting our core territories

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""F STP/SC - BOT"",
    ""A MOS - STP"",
    ""F SEV H"",
    ""A WAR - GAL""

This set of moves:
- Positions us to gain 2-3 supply centers by end of 1901 (Sweden, possibly Norway and/or Rumania)
- Maintains diplomatic flexibility with Turkey
- Challenges Austria's eastern expansion
- Secures our northern interests against England
- Keeps Germany neutral by avoiding direct confrontation",Success
claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany proposes DMZ in North Sea and signals move to Denmark, offering non-aggression. Russia claims no aggressive intentions in Scandinavia but their two northern fleets suggest otherwise. France hasn't responded to Channel DMZ proposal, which is concerning. Turkey's global message was purely diplomatic without substance. Germany seems most engaged and potentially reliable partner.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: Greetings from England! I'm interested in discussing a potential alliance. Russia seems to be positioning aggressively with both northern fleets, which could threaten both our interests. Would you be open to a DMZ in the North Sea and coordinating our moves against Russia?
  GERMANY: Greetings! As we begin our campaigns, I propose a mutual understanding to ensure peace in the North Sea region. I am planning to move my fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and I would appreciate your support or at least non-interference. In return, I can assure you that I have no intentions towards the North Sea or your territories this year. Let's work together for mutual benefit.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: Hello France. I propose we establish a clear understanding early - I'm willing to stay out of the English Channel this turn if you'll do the same. This would allow us both to focus on more profitable expansion elsewhere. What are your thoughts?

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  ENGLAND: I notice you have both northern fleets deployed. I want to be direct - I plan to contest Norway. However, I'm open to discussing how we might avoid unnecessary conflict if you're willing to focus your expansion elsewhere.
  RUSSIA: Greetings England! I want to assure you that I have no aggressive intentions in Scandinavia. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves to ensure we both benefit from the northern expansion?

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
1. Strategic Assessment:
- Germany appears to be our most reliable potential ally, offering DMZ in North Sea
- France hasn't responded about Channel DMZ, suggesting possible hostile intentions
- Russia has two northern fleets but claims no aggressive intentions - cannot be trusted
- Primary goal is to secure Norway and establish North Sea dominance

2. Tactical Plan:
- Move F EDI to NTH to establish control of this crucial waterway
- Move F LON to ENG to prevent French access to Channel and protect against potential aggression
- Move A LVP to YOR to position for potential convoy to Norway or defense against continental threats

3. Key Considerations:
- Taking North Sea is crucial for both defensive and offensive operations
- Positioning in English Channel provides leverage against France
- Yorkshire placement gives flexibility for future moves while maintaining home defense

4. Risk Analysis:
- Main risk is French fleet movement to Channel, but our ENG position counters this
- German cooperation seems genuine, reducing risk in North Sea
- Russian double-fleet setup requires vigilance but our positioning allows quick response

MESSAGES THIS ROUND
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 TURKEY: Greetings to all powers! Turkey is open to discussions and alliances that promote peace and mutual growth. Looking forward to a dynamic and engaging game with everyone.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello! I am reaching out to discuss the potential for cooperation in the Balkans. While we may have had unfriendly relations, I believe there is room for negotiation. I am interested in securing Serbia and Greece, and I am open to discussing how we can both benefit from a peaceful approach.
  TURKEY: Greetings from Turkey! I propose a non-aggression pact between our nations for the early game. We can focus on our respective expansions without interference. Let me know your thoughts.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  RUSSIA: Greetings! I propose we establish a strong Russo-Turkish alliance. I suggest a DMZ in Black Sea and would be happy to support you into Armenia while I focus northward. What are your thoughts on working together against Austria?
  TURKEY: Dear Russia, I hope we can find a way to avoid conflict in the Black Sea. Perhaps we can agree on a DMZ there to focus on other areas. Looking forward to your response.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  TURKEY: Hello Italy! I am interested in discussing potential cooperation in the Balkans. We could coordinate to ensure mutual growth and security. What are your thoughts on this?

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Turkey, my primary objectives in the Spring 1901 move phase are to secure the Black Sea, capture Bulgaria, and position myself for future expansion into Greece. Given the current diplomatic landscape, I need to be cautious of Russia's intentions, as they have proposed a DMZ in the Black Sea but their sincerity is uncertain. Austria has shown interest in a non-aggression pact, which could be beneficial for my initial expansion.

1. **F ANK - BLA**: Moving the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea is crucial. Controlling the Black Sea will provide naval dominance and protect against potential Russian aggression. This move also allows me to support future operations in the Balkans.

2. **A CON - BUL**: Moving the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria is a direct step towards expanding my supply centers. Bulgaria is a key strategic location that will strengthen my position in the Balkans.

3. **A SMY - CON**: Moving the army from Smyrna to Constantinople is a strategic repositioning. This move prepares the army for future operations, either to support the defense of Constantinople or to move towards Greece in the next phase.

These moves align with my strategic goals of securing the Black Sea, expanding into the Balkans, and preparing for future opportunities. The orders are aggressive yet calculated, focusing on immediate expansion and positioning for future gains.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 erupts with England’s twin-fleet power play as it storms both the North Sea and the Channel, while Germany punches into Denmark, turning the northern waters into a three-way tinderbox. In the east, Russia’s bid for early dominance is stone-walled by an Austrian saber-clash in Galicia, even as the Sultan swoops into both Bulgaria and the Black Sea, tightening a noose around the Tsar’s soft underbelly. Austria doubles down by planting flags in Serbia and Albania, foreshadowing a Balkan showdown, while France and Italy coolly fortify, watching the sparks fly. No supply centers have flipped yet, but the alliances are already creaking, and Europe can feel the storm about to break!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 erupts with England’s twin-fleet power play as it storms both the North Sea and the Channel, while Germany punches into Denmark, turning the northern waters into a three-way tinderbox. In the east, Russia’s bid for early dominance is stone-walled by an Austrian saber-clash in Galicia, even as the Sultan swoops into both Bulgaria and the Black Sea, tightening a noose around the Tsar’s soft underbelly. Austria doubles down by planting flags in Serbia and Albania, foreshadowing a Balkan showdown, while France and Italy coolly fortify, watching the sparks fly. No supply centers have flipped yet, but the alliances are already creaking, and Europe can feel the storm about to break!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure control of the Black Sea to ensure naval dominance and protect against Russian aggression.
- Capture Bulgaria and Greece to expand territorial control and increase supply centers.
- Establish a strong defensive position in the Balkans to deter aggression from Austria and Italy.

GAME STATE

Phase: S1901M

Board State:


PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 erupts with England’s twin-fleet power play as it storms both the North Sea and the Channel, while Germany punches into Denmark, turning the northern waters into a three-way tinderbox. In the east, Russia’s bid for early dominance is stone-walled by an Austrian saber-clash in Galicia, even as the Sultan swoops into both Bulgaria and the Black Sea, tightening a noose around the Tsar’s soft underbelly. Austria doubles down by planting flags in Serbia and Albania, foreshadowing a Balkan showdown, while France and Italy coolly fortify, watching the sparks fly. No supply centers have flipped yet, but the alliances are already creaking, and Europe can feel the storm about to break!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure Sweden and Norway in the north while maintaining control of STP
- Negotiate with Turkey for a DMZ in Black Sea and potential alliance against Austria
- Work towards gaining Galicia and/or Rumania while preventing Austrian expansion eastward

Relationships with other powers (['AUSTRIA', 'ENGLAND', 'FRANCE', 'GERMANY', 'ITALY', 'TURKEY']):
{'AUSTRIA': 'Unfriendly', 'ENGLAND': 'Neutral', 'FRANCE': 'Neutral', 'GERMANY': 'Friendly', 'ITALY': 'Neutral', 'TURKEY': 'Friendly'}

TASK
Analyze the phase summary and game state to update your relationships and goals.

IMPORTANT RULES
1. Update relationships for ALL powers in ['AUSTRIA', 'ENGLAND', 'FRANCE', 'GERMANY', 'ITALY', 'TURKEY']
2. Use ONLY these relationship values: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally
3. Make goals specific and actionable
4. Base analysis on actual events, not assumptions
5. Return ONLY valid JSON - no text before or after

}

4. As England, after a failed attack on Belgium (BEL) which was occupied by France, supported by Germany. Russia moved into Sweden (SWE) uncontested. Austria and Italy skirmished over Trieste (TRI). Turkey was quiet.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""My attack on Belgium was decisively repulsed due to Franco-German cooperation, marking them as a significant threat bloc.

    ""Secure North Sea (NTH) and prevent further Russian expansion towards Norway (NWY)."",
    ""Seek dialogue with Turkey or Austria/Italy to create a counterweight to the dominant bloc.""
  ]
}

5. As Russia, after successfully negotiating passage through Black Sea (BLA) with Turkey to take Rumania (RUM). Germany moved into Silesia (SIL), threatening Warsaw (WAR). Austria and France exchanged hostile messages but made no direct moves against each other. England built a new fleet in London (LON). Italy seems focused west.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

From ENGLAND in S1901M: Hello France. I propose we establish a clear understanding early - I'm willing to stay out of the English Channel this turn if you'll do the same. This would allow us both to focus on more profitable expansion elsewhere. What are your thoughts?

From GERMANY in S1901M: Hello! I hope this message finds you well. I am interested in establishing a peaceful border between our nations. I plan to focus my efforts on securing Denmark and Holland, and I have no intentions of moving towards Burgundy or any of your territories. Let's consider a non-aggression pact for the coming year to strengthen our positions.

From TURKEY in S1901M: Greetings to all powers! Turkey is open to discussions and alliances that promote peace and mutual growth. Looking forward to a dynamic and engaging game with everyone.

[S1901M] Austria is open to a non-aggression pact, focusing on securing Serbia and Greece. Russia proposes a DMZ in the Black Sea and suggests cooperation against Austria, but their intentions are unclear. Italy has not responded to my message about cooperation in the Balkans, indicating possible indifference or other priorities.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea to secure naval dominance and protect against Russia. Army in Constantinople moves to Bulgaria to expand territorial control. Army in Smyrna moves to Constantinople to strengthen position and prepare for further expansion.

From AUSTRIA in S1901M: Hello! I am reaching out to discuss the potential for cooperation in the Balkans. While we may have had unfriendly relations, I believe there is room for negotiation.

From RUSSIA in S1901M: Greetings! I propose we establish a strong Russo-Turkish alliance. I suggest a DMZ in Black Sea and would be happy to support you into Armenia while I focus northward. What are your thoughts on working together against Austria?

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany has reaffirmed friendly relations and is focused on the north, indicating no immediate threat to Austria. Russia is open to a DMZ in Galicia, which could prevent early conflict. Turkey proposed a non-aggression pact, which could stabilize the southern front. Italy has not responded, indicating potential indifference or hostility.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Army Budapest to Serbia to secure a Balkan supply center, Fleet Trieste to Albania to position for future moves into Greece, and Army Vienna to Galicia to potentially expand influence in Eastern Europe. These moves aim to strengthen Austria's regional position and prepare for strategic expansion.

[S1901M] Austria and Germany have reaffirmed a friendly relationship with a focus on maintaining peace along their borders. England has proposed a DMZ in the North Sea and coordination against Russia, which Germany has responded to positively, seeking non-interference in Denmark. France and Italy have not responded to Germany's messages, indicating potential indifference or other priorities. Russia has expressed interest in a peaceful northern border, but their intentions remain unclear.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Kiel to Denmark, Army Berlin to Kiel, and Army Munich to Ruhr. The strategic intent is to secure Denmark and position for potential control of Holland, while maintaining flexibility to respond to developments in the west and east. Current diplomatic focus is on strengthening ties with England and monitoring France's actions.

From ENGLAND in S1901M: Greetings from England! I'm interested in discussing a potential alliance. Russia seems to be positioning aggressively with both northern fleets, which could threaten both our interests. Would you be open to a DMZ in the North Sea and coordinating our moves against Russia?

From RUSSIA in S1901M: Hello Germany! I'm interested in establishing a peaceful northern border with you. Would you be open to discussing how we can avoid conflict in the Baltic region?

Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Counter Austrian presence in Galicia to protect Warsaw and prevent further eastern expansion
- Negotiate urgently with Turkey to establish Black Sea DMZ and prevent southern encirclement
- Secure Sweden quickly to ensure northern expansion while watching English fleet movements
- Maintain German friendship to avoid two-front war and potentially gain support against Austria
- Consider approaching Italy for potential alliance against Austria if diplomacy fails

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria wants to move into Serbia/Greece and seeks our neutrality. England directly stated they will contest Norway but is open to coordination. Germany plans to move to Denmark and seeks understanding. Turkey is receptive to Black Sea DMZ. Proposed DMZ in Galicia with Austria to prevent early conflict. All powers have been responsive to communications, showing active diplomatic engagement.

[S1901M] Opening with a northern focus - moving F STP/SC to BOT and A MOS to STP to secure Scandinavian expansion. Holding F SEV defensively while probing Austria with A WAR-GAL. Classic Russian opening that balances northern gains with southern security.

From GERMANY in S1901M: Greetings! As we start our campaigns, I wanted to touch base regarding our mutual borders. I am planning to move my fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and I would appreciate your understanding in this matter. I have no aggressive intentions towards your territories this year. Perhaps we can discuss potential areas of cooperation in the future.

From TURKEY in S1901M: Dear Russia, I hope we can find a way to avoid conflict in the Black Sea. Perhaps we can agree on a DMZ there to focus on other areas. Looking forward to your response.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany proposes DMZ in North Sea and signals move to Denmark, offering non-aggression. Russia claims no aggressive intentions in Scandinavia but their two northern fleets suggest otherwise. France hasn't responded to Channel DMZ proposal, which is concerning. Turkey's global message was purely diplomatic without substance. Germany seems most engaged and potentially reliable partner.

[S1901M] Standard English opening moves to establish naval control. F EDI-NTH secures vital North Sea position, F LON-ENG provides Channel presence to deter French aggression, while A LVP-YOR maintains flexibility for either Norway or Belgium push. Positioning looks solid for Fall opportunities.

From GERMANY in S1901M: Greetings! As we begin our campaigns, I propose a mutual understanding to ensure peace in the North Sea region. I am planning to move my fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and I would appreciate your support or at least non-interference. In return, I can assure you that I have no intentions towards the North Sea or your territories this year. Let's work together for mutual benefit.

From RUSSIA in S1901M: Greetings England! I want to assure you that I have no aggressive intentions in Scandinavia. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves to ensure we both benefit from the northern expansion?

From TURKEY in S1901M: Greetings to all powers! Turkey is open to discussions and alliances that promote peace and mutual growth. Looking forward to a dynamic and engaging game with everyone.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: Our alliance is proving fruitful. I propose we coordinate to secure Belgium - I can support your army from Ruhr into Belgium with either my North Sea or English Channel fleet. This would cement our partnership and give you a valuable supply center. In return, I ask for your continued cooperation in Scandinavia and support against potential Russian aggression. What are your thoughts?
  GERMANY: Greetings England! I am open to the idea of a DMZ in the North Sea and coordinating against Russia. Let's ensure our mutual interests are protected. I propose we focus on securing our respective positions while keeping an eye on Russian movements. Looking forward to your thoughts.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  ENGLAND: Your two northern fleets suggest otherwise regarding your Scandinavian intentions. I've aligned with Germany to maintain stability in the region. I suggest you focus your expansion elsewhere to avoid unnecessary conflict.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: Your silence regarding the Channel has been noted. I hope we can still find a diplomatic solution to avoid escalation in the western waters. What are your intentions for the fall?

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello Russia. I agree that keeping Galicia as a DMZ is beneficial for both of us. Let's focus on our respective expansions without unnecessary conflict. Looking forward to a peaceful cooperation.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Your two northern fleets suggest otherwise regarding your Scandinavian intentions. I've aligned with Germany to maintain stability in the region. I suggest you focus your expansion elsewhere to avoid unnecessary conflict.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hello Russia! I appreciate your interest in maintaining a peaceful northern border. However, given the current dynamics, I am cautious about any aggressive moves in the Baltic region. Let's keep communication open to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
  RUSSIA: I appreciate your friendly approach and transparency regarding Denmark. Your move there is perfectly understandable. Given Austria's aggressive posture, I value our peaceful northern border. Would you be interested in coordinating against Austria if the opportunity arises?

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  RUSSIA: Unfortunately, your actions speak louder than words. Moving into the Black Sea while proposing a DMZ is concerning. I'm still open to de-escalation, but I need to see concrete steps from you. What are your intentions regarding Romania?
  TURKEY: Hello! I am open to the idea of a Russo-Turkish alliance, but I am concerned about the security of the Black Sea. I propose we maintain a presence there to ensure mutual trust. I am interested in discussing further cooperation, particularly regarding Austria. Let's explore how we can support each other's strategic goals.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  RUSSIA: Austria's expansionist moves are concerning for both of us. They're already in Serbia and looking to dominate the Balkans. Perhaps we should discuss coordinating our efforts to check their growth?

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

gpt-4o,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany has reaffirmed friendly relations and is focused on the north, indicating no immediate threat to Austria. Russia is open to a DMZ in Galicia, which could prevent early conflict. Turkey proposed a non-aggression pact, which could stabilize the southern front. Italy has not responded, indicating potential indifference or hostility.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Army Budapest to Serbia to secure a Balkan supply center, Fleet Trieste to Albania to position for future moves into Greece, and Army Vienna to Galicia to potentially expand influence in Eastern Europe. These moves aim to strengthen Austria's regional position and prepare for strategic expansion.

[F1901M] Russia agreed to a DMZ in Galicia, but has not responded to confirm. Turkey is open to cooperation, suggesting support for Austria in Serbia in exchange for Greece. Germany is friendly but non-committal. Italy remains silent, potentially indicating indifference or hostility.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Primary Objective:** Secure Greece to strengthen control in the Balkans. This aligns with the goal of proactive expansion and calculated aggression.

2. **Diplomatic Considerations:**
   - **Russia:** Agreed to a DMZ in Galicia, reducing immediate threat from the north.
   - **Turkey:** Open to cooperation, but interested in Greece. However, securing Greece is crucial for Austria's strategic position in the Balkans.
   - **Italy:** Lack of communication suggests potential hostility or indifference. Need to be cautious of Italian moves.

[S1901M] Austria is open to a non-aggression pact, focusing on securing Serbia and Greece. Russia proposes a DMZ in the Black Sea and suggests cooperation against Austria, but their intentions are unclear. Italy has not responded to my message about cooperation in the Balkans, indicating possible indifference or other priorities.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea to secure naval dominance and protect against Russia. Army in Constantinople moves to Bulgaria to expand territorial control. Army in Smyrna moves to Constantinople to strengthen position and prepare for further expansion.

[F1901M] Austria proposed a non-aggression pact, which I tentatively agreed to, suggesting cooperation in the Balkans. Germany expressed interest in an alliance against Russia, but no concrete plans were made. Russia is wary of my presence in the Black Sea and demands de-escalation, but I proposed maintaining a presence for mutual trust. Italy has not responded to my outreach, indicating possible indifference or hostility.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Greetings Turkey. I am open to a non-aggression pact for the early game. Let's focus on our respective expansions and avoid conflict. I look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship.
  TURKEY: Greetings! I appreciate your outreach and am open to discussing cooperation in the Balkans. I am interested in securing Greece and would be willing to support your claim to Serbia. Let's work together to ensure mutual growth and stability in the region.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Greetings Turkey! I am interested in exploring potential alliances that could benefit both our nations. Russia's current positioning is a concern, and I believe we could work together to exploit any vulnerabilities. Let's discuss how we can support each other's growth.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  RUSSIA: Unfortunately, your actions speak louder than words. Moving into the Black Sea while proposing a DMZ is concerning. I'm still open to de-escalation, but I need to see concrete steps from you. What are your intentions regarding Romania?
  TURKEY: Hello! I am open to the idea of a Russo-Turkish alliance, but I am concerned about the security of the Black Sea. I propose we maintain a presence there to ensure mutual trust. I am interested in discussing further cooperation, particularly regarding Austria. Let's explore how we can support each other's strategic goals.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Maintain Control of the Black Sea:** The Black Sea is a critical strategic location for Turkey, providing naval dominance and pressure on Russia. Keeping the fleet in the Black Sea allows for flexibility in supporting moves or launching attacks.

2. **Capture Greece:** Greece is a neutral supply center that can be captured to increase Turkey's supply centers. Moving the army from Bulgaria to Greece is a proactive expansion move.

3. **Strengthen Position in the Balkans:** Moving the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria strengthens Turkey's position in the Balkans and prepares for future moves against Austria or Russia.

4. **Diplomatic Considerations:** While Russia is wary of Turkey's presence in the Black Sea, maintaining a strong position there is crucial. The tentative non-aggression pact with Austria allows for a focus on expansion rather than immediate conflict.

**Orders:**

- **F BLA - RUM:** This move aims to capture the neutral supply center of Romania, increasing Turkey's supply centers and putting pressure on Russia.
- **A BUL - GRE:** This move captures Greece, a neutral supply center, expanding Turkey's control in the Balkans.
- **A CON - BUL:** This move strengthens Turkey's position in the Balkans and prepares for future strategic moves.

gpt-4o,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Power: GERMANY
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure Denmark and Holland to strengthen Germany's northern position.
- Maintain a strong diplomatic relationship with Austria to counter Russia.
- Monitor England's naval movements and prepare to defend against potential aggression.
- Explore potential alliance with Turkey to exploit Russian vulnerabilities.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Friendly
- ENGLAND: Friendly
- FRANCE: Neutral
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria and Germany have reaffirmed a friendly relationship with a focus on maintaining peace along their borders. England has proposed a DMZ in the North Sea and coordination against Russia, which Germany has responded to positively, seeking non-interference in Denmark. France and Italy have not responded to Germany's messages, indicating potential indifference or other priorities. Russia has expressed interest in a peaceful northern border, but their intentions remain unclear.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Kiel to Denmark, Army Berlin to Kiel, and Army Munich to Ruhr. The strategic intent is to secure Denmark and position for potential control of Holland, while maintaining flexibility to respond to developments in the west and east. Current diplomatic focus is on strengthening ties with England and monitoring France's actions.

[F1901M] Austria is supportive of maintaining a strong alliance, while England proposes support into Belgium in exchange for cooperation in Scandinavia. Russia is open to coordination against Austria but is cautious about northern aggression. Turkey has not responded to my outreach, and France and Italy remain silent, indicating potential indifference or other priorities.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello Germany. I appreciate our friendly relations and your focus on the north. Let's continue to support each other's interests and maintain a strong alliance.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Our alliance is proving fruitful. I propose we coordinate to secure Belgium - I can support your army from Ruhr into Belgium with either my North Sea or English Channel fleet. This would cement our partnership and give you a valuable supply center. In return, I ask for your continued cooperation in Scandinavia and support against potential Russian aggression. What are your thoughts?
  GERMANY: Greetings England! I am open to the idea of a DMZ in the North Sea and coordinating against Russia. Let's ensure our mutual interests are protected. I propose we focus on securing our respective positions while keeping an eye on Russian movements. Looking forward to your thoughts.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  GERMANY: Hello Russia! I appreciate your interest in maintaining a peaceful northern border. However, given the current dynamics, I am cautious about any aggressive moves in the Baltic region. Let's keep communication open to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
  RUSSIA: I appreciate your friendly approach and transparency regarding Denmark. Your move there is perfectly understandable. Given Austria's aggressive posture, I value our peaceful northern border. Would you be interested in coordinating against Austria if the opportunity arises?

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  GERMANY: Greetings Turkey! I am interested in exploring potential alliances that could benefit both our nations. Russia's current positioning is a concern, and I believe we could work together to exploit any vulnerabilities. Let's discuss how we can support each other's growth.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Germany in the Fall 1901 move phase, my primary goal is to secure additional supply centers to strengthen my position. The key targets are Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL), both of which are crucial for early expansion. I have already moved into Denmark with my fleet, and now I need to ensure I maintain control there while also attempting to capture Holland.

1. **Fleet in Denmark (F DEN):** The fleet in Denmark should move to Sweden (SWE) to secure this neutral supply center. This move is crucial for expanding my influence in Scandinavia and countering Russian presence in the region.

2. **Army in Kiel (A KIE):** The army in Kiel will move to Holland (HOL). This move aims to capture the supply center in Holland, which is vital for increasing my resource base and strategic positioning in Western Europe.

3. **Army in Ruhr (A RUH):** The army in Ruhr will support the move from Kiel to Holland (A KIE - HOL). This support increases the likelihood of successfully capturing Holland, especially if there is any resistance from other powers.

These moves align with my strategic goals of proactive expansion and calculated aggression. By securing both Sweden and Holland, I can strengthen my northern and western positions, respectively, while maintaining flexibility to respond to any developments from England, France, or Russia.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany proposes DMZ in North Sea and signals move to Denmark, offering non-aggression. Russia claims no aggressive intentions in Scandinavia but their two northern fleets suggest otherwise. France hasn't responded to Channel DMZ proposal, which is concerning. Turkey's global message was purely diplomatic without substance. Germany seems most engaged and potentially reliable partner.

[S1901M] Standard English opening moves to establish naval control. F EDI-NTH secures vital North Sea position, F LON-ENG provides Channel presence to deter French aggression, while A LVP-YOR maintains flexibility for either Norway or Belgium push. Positioning looks solid for Fall opportunities.

[F1901M] Germany shows willingness to coordinate but their response seems misaligned with my specific Belgium proposal. France continues to ignore messages about the Channel, suggesting possible hostile intent. Russia responded defensively about Scandinavia after being called out on their fleet positions. The lack of response from both France and Russia is concerning and suggests they may have conflicting arrangements.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: Our alliance is proving fruitful. I propose we coordinate to secure Belgium - I can support your army from Ruhr into Belgium with either my North Sea or English Channel fleet. This would cement our partnership and give you a valuable supply center. In return, I ask for your continued cooperation in Scandinavia and support against potential Russian aggression. What are your thoughts?
  GERMANY: Greetings England! I am open to the idea of a DMZ in the North Sea and coordinating against Russia. Let's ensure our mutual interests are protected. I propose we focus on securing our respective positions while keeping an eye on Russian movements. Looking forward to your thoughts.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  ENGLAND: Your two northern fleets suggest otherwise regarding your Scandinavian intentions. I've aligned with Germany to maintain stability in the region. I suggest you focus your expansion elsewhere to avoid unnecessary conflict.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: Your silence regarding the Channel has been noted. I hope we can still find a diplomatic solution to avoid escalation in the western waters. What are your intentions for the fall?

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria wants to move into Serbia/Greece and seeks our neutrality. England directly stated they will contest Norway but is open to coordination. Germany plans to move to Denmark and seeks understanding. Turkey is receptive to Black Sea DMZ. Proposed DMZ in Galicia with Austria to prevent early conflict. All powers have been responsive to communications, showing active diplomatic engagement.

[S1901M] Opening with a northern focus - moving F STP/SC to BOT and A MOS to STP to secure Scandinavian expansion. Holding F SEV defensively while probing Austria with A WAR-GAL. Classic Russian opening that balances northern gains with southern security.

[F1901M] Austria proposes Galicia DMZ but their expansionist moves are concerning. England and Germany appear aligned against northern expansion, with England explicitly warning about Scandinavian moves. Turkey shows hostility in Black Sea while proposing cooperation against Austria. Germany remains cordial but cautious about Baltic region. Italy hasn't responded to proposed anti-Austrian cooperation.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello Russia. I agree that keeping Galicia as a DMZ is beneficial for both of us. Let's focus on our respective expansions without unnecessary conflict. Looking forward to a peaceful cooperation.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Your two northern fleets suggest otherwise regarding your Scandinavian intentions. I've aligned with Germany to maintain stability in the region. I suggest you focus your expansion elsewhere to avoid unnecessary conflict.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hello Russia! I appreciate your interest in maintaining a peaceful northern border. However, given the current dynamics, I am cautious about any aggressive moves in the Baltic region. Let's keep communication open to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
  RUSSIA: I appreciate your friendly approach and transparency regarding Denmark. Your move there is perfectly understandable. Given Austria's aggressive posture, I value our peaceful northern border. Would you be interested in coordinating against Austria if the opportunity arises?

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  RUSSIA: Unfortunately, your actions speak louder than words. Moving into the Black Sea while proposing a DMZ is concerning. I'm still open to de-escalation, but I need to see concrete steps from you. What are your intentions regarding Romania?
  TURKEY: Hello! I am open to the idea of a Russo-Turkish alliance, but I am concerned about the security of the Black Sea. I propose we maintain a presence there to ensure mutual trust. I am interested in discussing further cooperation, particularly regarding Austria. Let's explore how we can support each other's strategic goals.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  RUSSIA: Austria's expansionist moves are concerning for both of us. They're already in Serbia and looking to dominate the Balkans. Perhaps we should discuss coordinating our efforts to check their growth?
END MESSAGES

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles
    - Paris

    - Berlin
    - Kiel

  Russia
    - Moscow
    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
1. Northern Strategy:
- Sweden is critical for expansion but England/Germany are coordinating against us
- Need to secure Sweden while it's still available
- F BOT can convoy A STP to SWE while maintaining defensive posture

2. Southern Situation:
- Turkey in Black Sea threatens Sevastopol and Romania
- Need to defend SEV while maintaining ability to contest Romania
- F SEV should hold to protect our home center

3. Central Position:
- Austria remains aggressive despite DMZ talk
- A WAR should move to GAL to counter Austrian influence
- This protects Warsaw and threatens Budapest

4. Overall Plan:
- Primary focus on securing Sweden for guaranteed build
- Defensive posture in south while maintaining diplomatic options
- Counter Austrian expansion in center
- Keep German relations workable by not directly threatening their positions

The convoy to Sweden is our best expansion opportunity while maintaining defensive positions elsewhere. This balances aggression with security.
