gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for TURKEY in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's immediate goal is to secure and expand within its core regions—Naples, Rome, and Venice—while positioning for future expansion against Austria and France. Austria is our primary enemy, controlling Trieste, Vienna, and Budapest, which are key targets for expansion. France remains unfriendly, especially with Marseille and Paris nearby, but for now, I will avoid provoking them early and focus on consolidating my position.

In this phase, I will:

- Support the Army in Venice to move into Trieste, aiming to take that supply center from Austria.
- Use the Fleet in Naples to support the Army in Venice, ensuring the attack on Trieste succeeds.
- Keep the Army in Rome on hold to defend against potential French or Austrian counterattacks.
- Use the Fleet in Ionian Sea to support the attack on Trieste from the sea, increasing the chances of success.
- Prepare for future expansion into other centers like Tyl, TUN, or BUD, but focus on Trieste first.

This move is aggressive but calculated, aiming to weaken Austria early and gain a critical supply center. Securing Trieste will bring Italy closer to the 18 centers needed for victory.

**Orders:**

- A VEN S A APU - TRI (supporting Venice to attack Trieste)
- A APU - TRI (moving into Trieste)
- F ION S A VEN - TRI (supporting Venice's attack from the sea)
- A ROM H (hold Rome for now)
- F NAP - TYS (preparing to defend or support future moves)

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand Austria’s control of supply centers, especially in the Balkans and Italy, to set up for a strong mid-game. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with RUM, SER, and BUL nearby as potential targets for expansion. Our friendly relationship with Germany offers an opportunity to coordinate against France and Russia, while our unfriendly stance toward Russia and Turkey suggests we should prepare for potential conflicts on those fronts.

In this phase, I will focus on consolidating our current holdings and positioning for future expansion. Moving A BUD to RUM is a strong move to threaten RUM and potentially secure it next turn. Supporting A WAR from GAL to SER can help us threaten the Russian front and keep Russia occupied. Moving A VIE to BUD is a defensive move to reinforce our core centers and prevent Russian or Italian incursions.

F TRI will hold, maintaining flexibility for future moves, but I am considering supporting A VEN to TRI in the next turn to push into Italy, especially if Italy becomes hostile or overextended. For now, I will keep F TRI holding to avoid unnecessary risks.

This setup allows us to threaten RUM and SER, maintain a strong position in the Balkans, and prepare for expansion into Italy or further into the Balkans next turn.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand and secure supply centers aggressively, especially in the North Sea, English Channel, and nearby regions. We have a friendly relationship with France, which can be leveraged to contain Germany and open opportunities in Scandinavia and the Low Countries. Germany is unfriendly, so we should be cautious about overextending into their territory but remain prepared to seize weak points.

Currently, our units are positioned to maintain control of our core centers and prepare for expansion:

- F EDI (English Channel) can support or move into the North Sea or YOR.
- F LON (London) can move to YOR or support other moves.
- A LVP (Liverpool) is well-placed to support moves into the North Sea or YOR.

Our immediate strategic options include:

- Moving F EDI into the North Sea to threaten German and Scandinavian approaches.
- Moving F LON into YOR to threaten or support YOR expansion.
- Moving A LVP into YOR or supporting F LON to push into Scandinavia or the Low Countries.
- Considering a move into Belgium (BEL) or Holland (HOL) if opportunities arise, but these are a bit further.

Given the current map and the need for proactive expansion, I will:

- Move F EDI to NTH to threaten Germany and support future moves.
- Move F LON to YOR to threaten the Scandinavian coast and support expansion.
- Support A LVP into YOR to reinforce the push into Scandinavia.
- Hold the other units for flexibility and defense.

This approach aims to threaten Germany and Scandinavia, open paths for expansion, and maintain flexibility for future turns.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia, leveraging our friendly relations with Russia to contain Austria and Italy. Currently, our units are positioned to threaten Austria and Italy, and we should capitalize on this by pushing into their supply centers or strategic positions.

- **Ankara (ANK):** We should move to support our position and threaten Bulgaria (BUL) and Rumania (RUM). Moving F ANK to CON or BLA can threaten Bulgaria or Rumania, but since Bulgaria is only 2 moves away via BLA, supporting CON to BUL seems promising.
- **Constantinople (CON):** Moving to BUL or supporting the attack on BUL will help us secure that key Balkan center, which is vital for expansion.
- **Smyrna (SMY):** Moving to CON or supporting CON to BUL can help us secure the Balkans further, and also threaten Greece or the Aegean.

Given the current map, I will:
- Support CON to BUL to secure Bulgaria.
- Move F ANK to CON to threaten Rumania and support the overall Balkan expansion.
- Keep SMY supporting CON or moving to CON to reinforce the attack.

This will help us secure Bulgaria, Rumania, and threaten Greece, setting us up for further expansion into the Balkans and possibly into Greece or the Aegean in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**
- F ANK S A CON (supporting CON to BUL)
- F ANK - CON (moving to support the attack on Bulgaria)
- A CON - BUL (attacking Bulgaria)
- A SMY - CON (supporting CON to BUL or threatening Greece)

This aggressive stance will help us secure key Balkan centers and prepare for further expansion.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Germany's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure as many supply centers as possible. Currently, we hold three centers (BER, KIE, MUN) and are well-positioned to push into neighboring neutral centers and threaten Russia and France.

- I will focus on consolidating control of the German heartland while pushing into Denmark and the Low Countries, which are critical for expansion and strategic positioning.
- Moving F KIE to DEN and A BER to KIE will help secure Denmark and threaten Holland, while A MUN supports a move into Silesia or supports a move to PRU to threaten Russia.
- Since Russia is unfriendly and controls STP, WAR, and MOS, I will prepare to threaten or support a move into PRU to pressure Russia.
- I will hold A BER for now, but keep options open for future expansion.
- Fleet in KIE will move to DEN to threaten the North Sea and support future moves into the Low Countries or Scandinavia.
- I will support A MUN into SIL to threaten or take the Swedish supply center, and support A WAR into PRU to threaten Russia.

This aggressive stance aims to expand into Denmark, the Low Countries, and threaten Russia early, setting up for a larger push in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- F KIE - DEN
- A BER - KIE
- A MUN S A WAR - PRU
- A WAR - PRU
- A SIL - STP (supporting to threaten or take Sweden if opportunity arises)
- Hold A BER for now

**Note:** Support moves are chosen to maximize pressure on Russia and expand into neutral centers.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure key supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. We need to push into unclaimed centers like RUM, ANK, and BUD, and consider strategic moves against Austria, Turkey, and Germany to maximize gains.

- **Sevastopol (SEV):** We should support the move to RUM to secure a vital eastern center and threaten Turkey's holdings.
- **Moscow (MOS):** Moving to Ukraine (UKR) can threaten Austria and open a path toward RUM, while supporting expansion into Ukraine and potentially further west.
- **War (WAR):** Moving to Galicia (GAL) will threaten Austria's key centers and open options for future expansion into Austria or further west.
- **Support and flexibility:** Holding units in SEV and WAR to support aggressive moves, while considering future support for RUM or BUD.

Given the current positions and the unfriendly relationships with Austria, Turkey, and Germany, I will prioritize aggressive expansion into RUM and Ukraine, while maintaining flexibility to respond to threats.

**Orders:**

- A SEV S F ANK - ARM (supporting Turkey’s move to ARM, or preparing to threaten Turkey)
- F SEV S A BUD - RUM (supporting the move to secure RUM)
- A MOS - UKR (advance into Ukraine to threaten Austria and open expansion routes)
- A WAR S A GAL - SIL (supporting Galicia to threaten Austria and open future options)
- A WAR - GAL (move to Galicia to threaten Austria and expand influence)

This aggressive stance aims to secure RUM, threaten Austria and Turkey, and position for further expansion.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW",".

**Reasoning:**

Our immediate priority is to secure and expand our control over supply centers to reach the 18 needed for victory. Currently, France controls BRE, MAR, and PAR, totaling 3 SCs. We need to aggressively push into neighboring centers, especially those controlled by other powers or unclaimed.

In S1901M, I want to secure a strong position, especially in the West. Our fleet in BRE can threaten the English Channel, but given the hostility from England, I prefer to avoid direct conflict at this stage. Instead, I will hold BRE for now to maintain flexibility.

MAR is a critical territory. We can either hold or try to push into SPA or BUR. SPA is only one move away, and capturing it early can give us an advantage. Moving A MAR to SPA is a straightforward expansion move.

PAR is also vital, as it controls a key center and is a natural staging point for future expansion eastward. Moving A PAR to BUR can help threaten Germany's supply centers and open up future opportunities.

Our fleets in the Mediterranean (not listed in the current moves, but I plan to keep them flexible) can be used for future operations.

Diplomatically, I will focus on avoiding early conflict with England and Germany, but I remain cautious of their hostility.

**Moves:**
- A MAR to SPA to claim a nearby unclaimed center.
- A PAR to BUR to threaten German centers and prepare for future expansion.
- Hold BRE for now, as aggressive moves could provoke conflict with England.
- Fleet in BRE remains on hold to maintain flexibility.

**Orders:**
- A MAR - SPA
- A PAR S A MAR - SPA
- A BRE H

**Final plan:** Secure SPA and threaten German centers while avoiding unnecessary early conflicts. This gives us a foothold in the south and prepares for more aggressive expansion next turns.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Boom!  Russia and Austria burst out of the gates as partners in crime—Sevastopol’s guns prop up an Austrian dash into Rumania while Russian armies storm Galicia and Ukraine, forging an ominous pincer aimed straight at the Sultan.  Turkey face-plants: a bungled double-move leaves Constantinople shockingly vacant, so the Sultan grabs only Bulgaria and now dangles exposed on two fronts.  Out west the grab-fest goes textbook—Germany slips into Denmark, France marches into sunny Spain, and England locks down the North Sea while sneaking a fleet to Yorkshire for autumn mischief.  With Italy’s Tyrrhenian warship prowling and Vienna fist-bumping the Tsar, the table tilts hard against a reeling Turkey, and the Eastern Front is about to erupt.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand control over the North Sea and English Channel to establish dominance in Western Europe.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Boom!  Russia and Austria burst out of the gates as partners in crime—Sevastopol’s guns prop up an Austrian dash into Rumania while Russian armies storm Galicia and Ukraine, forging an ominous pincer aimed straight at the Sultan.  Turkey face-plants: a bungled double-move leaves Constantinople shockingly vacant, so the Sultan grabs only Bulgaria and now dangles exposed on two fronts.  Out west the grab-fest goes textbook—Germany slips into Denmark, France marches into sunny Spain, and England locks down the North Sea while sneaking a fleet to Yorkshire for autumn mischief.  With Italy’s Tyrrhenian warship prowling and Vienna fist-bumping the Tsar, the table tilts hard against a reeling Turkey, and the Eastern Front is about to erupt.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure the Western Front by establishing a strong position in Belgium and the Low Countries, potentially through an early attack on Belgium or supporting moves to gain control of key centers.
- Form a strategic alliance with either France or England to focus on a common enemy, such as Russia or Austria, while preparing for a potential betrayal once a position of strength is achieved.
- Expand into Scandinavia and Eastern Europe by supporting moves into Denmark, Sweden, or Poland, leveraging Germany's central position to threaten multiple fronts and increase supply centers.

The western powers are expanding aggressively, with Germany into Denmark, France into Spain, and England securing the North Sea. Turkey's position is precarious, with a need to reassess alliances and strategic goals. Russia remains friendly, likely due to their cooperation in the east, while Austria is clearly unfriendly given their aggressive moves.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Boom!  Russia and Austria burst out of the gates as partners in crime—Sevastopol’s guns prop up an Austrian dash into Rumania while Russian armies storm Galicia and Ukraine, forging an ominous pincer aimed straight at the Sultan.  Turkey face-plants: a bungled double-move leaves Constantinople shockingly vacant, so the Sultan grabs only Bulgaria and now dangles exposed on two fronts.  Out west the grab-fest goes textbook—Germany slips into Denmark, France marches into sunny Spain, and England locks down the North Sea while sneaking a fleet to Yorkshire for autumn mischief.  With Italy’s Tyrrhenian warship prowling and Vienna fist-bumping the Tsar, the table tilts hard against a reeling Turkey, and the Eastern Front is about to erupt.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in Italy's immediate neighborhood by establishing control over key supply centers such as Trieste, Venice, and Rome, while preparing to challenge Austria and France for additional centers.
- Form a strategic alliance with either Germany or France to counterbalance Austria and potentially open a front against Turkey or Russia, depending on diplomatic developments.
- Maintain a flexible stance with England and Russia, avoiding early conflicts while monitoring their movements for future opportunistic strikes.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with France, emphasizing naval cooperation and mutual defense in the North Sea and English Channel. Germany remains unfriendly, with no response to recent messages, indicating potential hostility or disinterest. Russia and Turkey are neutral, with no recent engagement, while Austria and Italy are also unresponsive. No formal agreements have been reached this turn, but diplomatic channels remain open with France and Russia.

[S1901M] England is moving F EDI to NTH, F LON to YOR, A LVP to YOR, and A LVP to H, aiming to secure the North Sea and English Channel, strengthen naval presence, and prepare for expansion in Western Europe while maintaining friendly relations with France.

[F1901M] England maintains a defensive stance with units in North Sea, York, and Liverpool, focusing on consolidating naval control. No new diplomatic agreements have been reached this turn, but ongoing communication with Russia remains positive, reinforcing their role as an ally. France and Germany remain unfriendly, with no progress in negotiations. Italy and Austria are neutral or allied, respectively, but their positions are not actively engaged this turn.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",

    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control three centers: EDI, LON, and LVP. We need to seize nearby centers to accelerate our expansion.

- The North Sea (NTH) is a critical area for control and expansion. Moving F NTH to YOR or EDI can threaten or take control of these centers.
- The units in YOR and LVP are well-positioned to support moves into unclaimed centers like BEL, HOL, and DEN.
- Germany's units (F DEN, A BER, A MUN) are potential threats, but they are currently unfocused on our immediate expansion.
- Our fleet in YOR can move to EDI or NTH to threaten or take control of these centers.
- The fleet in NTH can move to YOR or EDI to support expansion or defend.

Given the current positions, I will focus on aggressive expansion into the Low Countries and Scandinavia, aiming to take control of Belgium, Holland, and Denmark, which are all within reach and critical for further expansion.

**Order plan:**

- F NTH to YOR to threaten or take YOR.
- F YOR to EDI to threaten or take EDI.
- A LVP to YOR to support the fleet move and threaten Belgium.
- Support moves to secure these centers and prepare for further expansion into Scandinavia or France.

This approach maximizes our expansion potential and positions us to threaten Germany's centers, while also consolidating control of the North Sea and English Channel.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy's messages this turn were silent, indicating a possible focus on internal planning or strategic patience. Relationships with Austria and Russia remain hostile, with Austria as an enemy and Russia as unfriendly. France and England are neutral, while Germany is neutral. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn.

[S1901M] I am holding Rome and Venice to consolidate my position in Italy, while moving my fleet from Naples to Tyrolia to prepare for potential expansion or defense. This setup aims to secure key centers and maintain flexibility for future diplomatic and military actions.

[F1901M] Italy's messages remain silent this turn, indicating a possible strategic pause or reluctance to commit. Relations with Austria, France, Germany, England, Russia, and Turkey are currently hostile or unfriendly, reflecting the tense and aggressive game state. No new agreements or alliances have been established this phase.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
Italy's immediate focus is on consolidating control of its core centers—Rome, Venice, and Naples—while preparing for expansion against Austria and France. The current positions suggest a defensive stance in Italy, with units holding or moving cautiously. However, to achieve world domination, I need to shift toward aggressive expansion, especially targeting Austria's key centers (Trieste and Buda) and possibly opening a front against France or Turkey later.

Given the current orders, I will:
- Support the move of A VEN to TRI to threaten Austria's Trieste, aiming to dislodge or pressure Austria's holdings.
- Use A APU to support A VEN to TRI, reinforcing the attack.
- Move F ION to support the attack on TRI from the sea, increasing the chances of success.
- Keep A ROM on hold to defend Italy's capital.
- Move F NAP to TYS to threaten or contest the Tyrrhenian Sea, possibly supporting future moves or defending against French or other fleet incursions.

This plan aims to weaken Austria early, gain Trieste, and set the stage for further expansion into Austria's Buda and Vienna, while maintaining flexibility for future moves against France or Turkey.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is AUSTRIA. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: AUSTRIA
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Strengthen alliance with Russia to secure the eastern front and coordinate against Turkey and Germany.
- Exploit Turkey's exposed position by pressuring Constantinople and Bulgaria to expand in the Balkans.
- Secure and expand in Rumania and Galicia to increase supply centers and build a stronger foothold.
- Maintain a flexible stance with Germany to prevent early encirclement while preparing for potential conflicts with Russia and Turkey.
- Monitor and adapt to Western developments, avoiding overextension while positioning for future expansion.
Relationships: - ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Unfriendly
- GERMANY: Friendly
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Ally
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria maintains a defensive stance with Italy and Turkey, focusing on consolidating Balkan centers and preparing for potential conflicts with Russia and Turkey. Germany remains friendly, offering opportunities for cooperation, while France and Russia are unfriendly, with limited communication. England remains neutral but unresponsive to recent messages, indicating a cautious or distant approach.

[S1901M] I am moving A VIE to BUD to secure the Balkans and support expansion, while A BUD is ordered to RUM to threaten Turkey and gain influence in the region. F TRI is held in place to maintain flexibility and prepare for future actions.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and secure key centers to build a strong position for eventual domination. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with RUM and GAL nearby as promising targets for expansion. Our immediate focus should be on consolidating our position in the Balkans and pushing into Rumania and Galicia, which are close and accessible.

- Moving A BUD to GAL supports our expansion into Galicia, threatening Russia and potentially cutting off Russian units.
- Moving A RUM to SEV is a bold move to threaten the Russian fleet and gain influence in the Black Sea, which could open up future options for expansion into Turkey or the Caucasus.
- Supporting A RUM with A BUD from BUD to GAL ensures a strong push into Galicia, which is a critical step toward controlling more centers.
- F TRI is held to maintain flexibility and support our armies if needed.
- Moving A GAL to RUM is an alternative, but attacking SEV seems more aggressive and promising for expansion.
- Holding VIE keeps our position stable in the west, avoiding overextension.

This plan aims to pressure Russia and Turkey, expand in the Balkans, and position Austria for future aggressive moves toward Rumania, Bulgaria, and possibly further into the Ottoman Empire.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Russia this turn, indicating a possible strategic pause or disengagement. Our relationships remain hostile with Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Turkey. Our units are positioned for potential expansion, with a focus on securing key eastern and northern centers.

[S1901M] Russia orders F SEV to support RUM, A MOS to Ukraine, A WAR to Galicia, and F STP/SC to hold. The strategic focus is on consolidating control over key eastern centers, strengthening positions in SEV and WAR, and maintaining flexibility for future expansion into Western Europe while managing hostile relationships.

[F1901M] Maintained a strong alliance with Austria, focusing on coordinated expansion into the Balkans and Eastern Europe. No new messages from other powers, indicating potential hostility or disinterest. Turkey remains an enemy, and Western powers (England, France, Germany, Italy) are unresponsive, possibly consolidating their own positions or avoiding commitments. Russia's current stance is defensive, with units positioned to defend key eastern centers.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively into key centers, especially in the Balkans and Eastern Europe, while maintaining a strong eastern front. Currently, Russia controls MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR, with potential to push further into BUD, RUM, and possibly into the Balkans.

- The units in GAL and UKR are well-positioned to threaten Austria's BUD and RUM, which are critical for our expansion.
- The fleet in SEV can support moves into RUM or threaten Turkey's holdings.
- Our immediate focus should be on consolidating control over RUM and BUD, and pushing into the Balkans to weaken Austria and Turkey.
- We should also consider supporting the move of GAL into VIE to threaten Austria further.
- The support moves should be coordinated to maximize pressure on Austria and Turkey, while defending our eastern positions.

Given the current options, I will:
- Move GAL to BUD to threaten Austria's BUD.
- Support RUM from UKR to ensure it falls under our control.
- Move UKR to RUM to threaten Austria's RUM and open up future expansion.
- Support the move of SEV to RUM to reinforce our hold.
- Hold the units in STP and WAR for defense and flexibility.

This aggressive stance aims to weaken Austria and Turkey, expand our control in the Balkans, and set up for further expansion in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- A GAL - BUD
- A UKR - RUM
- A RUM S A UKR - RUM
- F SEV S A GAL - BUD

[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, emphasizing cooperation in the Balkans and Black Sea. Austria, France, Germany, and Italy remain unfriendly, with limited engagement from Italy and Austria. No new agreements or commitments were made this turn, and some powers continue to be unresponsive.

[S1901M] I am moving F ANK to CON to secure the Black Sea and threaten the Balkans, while supporting A CON to BUL to strengthen my position in Anatolia. I am also advancing A SMY to CON to exert pressure on the region and prepare for future expansion.

[F1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, reinforcing the alliance and coordinating defensive and offensive plans. No new messages from Austria, England, France, or Germany, indicating possible disengagement or strategic silence. Italy remains unfriendly, with no recent communication. The game state shows Turkey holding Ank, Smy, and Constantinople, with a focus on consolidating Balkan control and preparing for potential conflicts with Austria and Italy.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Turkey controls Ank, Smy, and Constantinople, with potential to expand into Bulgaria, Rumania, and possibly further into Austria or Italy.

- Bulgaria (BUL) is a key target, as it is only two moves away from our current positions and can be supported by Bulgaria itself or by our armies.
- Rumania (RUM) is also accessible via Bulgaria or directly from Smyrna, and controlling it would be a significant step toward domination.
- The nearby supply centers of Rumania and Bulgaria are critical for our expansion, and we should aim to secure them early.
- Our fleet in Ank is well-positioned to threaten the Black Sea and support moves into Bulgaria or Rumania.
- Smyrna can support or move to strengthen our position in the Balkans or threaten Austria's holdings.
- Since Austria is unfriendly, we should prepare to pressure their borders, especially in Rumania and Galicia, and threaten their supply centers.
- Our Russian ally is friendly, so we should coordinate to avoid conflicts and possibly support each other's expansion.

Orders should focus on consolidating our position in the Balkans, supporting Bulgaria and Rumania, and positioning for future expansion into Austria or Italy.

**Order choices:**

- F ANK to CON: Secure the Black Sea and threaten the Balkans.
- A BUL to RUM: Support expansion into Rumania.
- A SMY to BUL: Support Bulgaria or threaten Austria's flank.
- Support A BUL to RUM from Smyrna to ensure success.
- Hold Smyrna to maintain flexibility.
- No moves for Constantinople this turn, as we focus on expansion.

**Orders:**

- F ANK - CON
- A BUL - RUM
- A SMY S A BUL - RUM
- A SMY - BUL
- A CONSTANTINOPLE H

This setup aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumania, expand our influence in the Balkans, and position Turkey for further aggressive moves next turn.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary focus is on expanding into Scandinavia and Eastern Europe to secure additional supply centers, while maintaining pressure on Russia and Austria. I want to establish a northern stronghold by taking Denmark and possibly Sweden, and threaten Poland and Ukraine to destabilize Russia’s position.

- Moving F DEN to HEL and F DEN to SKA will secure the Baltic and Scandinavia, giving me access to more centers and a strategic foothold.
- Supporting F NTH into the North Sea will help secure the channel and threaten England, keeping them on the defensive.
- Moving A BER to KIE consolidates my position in the north and prepares for future expansion into Holland or further into Scandinavia.
- Moving A MUN to SIL aims to threaten or support against Russia’s units in Galicia or Ukraine, while also positioning for future expansion.
- Holding Munich (A MUN H) to defend my core centers and prepare for further moves.
- I will support A GAL to SIL from MUN if needed, but for now, I will hold and focus on expansion.

This aggressive stance aims to secure key centers early, destabilize Russia, and set up for a broader push into Eastern Europe and Scandinavia.

**Orders:**

- F DEN - HEL
- F DEN - SKA
- F NTH - NTH
- A BER - KIE
- A MUN - SIL
- A MUN H
- A GAL - SIL

**Note:** No support orders are needed at this stage, as I am focusing on securing my initial expansion routes.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

[S1901M] (LLM diary entry generation or parsing failed.)

[S1901M] I am holding Marseille and Paris to strengthen the Western Front, and moving the fleet from Brest to the English Channel for better positioning. I plan to engage diplomatically with England and Germany to maintain neutrality, while preparing defenses against Turkey and Russia. My focus is on consolidating control over Western France and avoiding early conflicts.

[F1901M] France and England are unresponsive to recent diplomatic outreach, indicating possible hostility or strategic silence. Italy and Austria remain neutral, while Russia and Turkey are hostile or unfriendly. No formal agreements have been reached, but the overall diplomatic environment is tense.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW",".

**Reasoning:**

France's primary goal in this phase is to secure its core supply centers: PAR, MAR, and BRE. Given the current map and diplomatic situation, I want to maintain a strong Western front while preparing for expansion into neighboring centers like BEL, LON, and POR.

- I will hold PAR to keep control of the French heartland and prevent German or Italian encroachments.
- Moving F BRE to Gas is a flexible move; it can support the fleet in Brest or help in future offensives. Moving F BRE to ENG would be risky given the hostility from England, so I will support an eventual move into the English Channel if the situation demands.
- I will support A SPA from SPA to MAR to try to secure the Spanish coast and possibly push into Morocco later.
- Since I want to expand, I will move F BRE to Gas to prepare for future moves into the Atlantic or support other fleets.
- No immediate threats are pressing from Austria, Russia, or Turkey, so I will focus on consolidating Western France and preparing for expansion.

The strategic move to control the English Channel might come later, but for now, I will support my armies and fleets to secure my borders and open pathways for expansion.

**Orders:**

- F BRE S A SPA - MAR (supporting SPA to MAR)
- A PAR H (hold to maintain control)
- F BRE - GAS (prepare for future expansion)
- A SPA - MAR (aggressive move to take Spain's coast)
- F NTH - ENG (position for future moves or support)

**Note:** I am not moving into the English Channel now to avoid unnecessary conflict, but I keep it in mind for future turns.

    ""F BRE S A SPA - MAR"",
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""F BRE - GAS"",
    ""A SPA - MAR"",
    ""F NTH - ENG""
  ]
}

**Reasoning:**

My focus this turn is on consolidating control over my core centers and setting up for expansion into neighboring regions. I want to strengthen my Western Europe position while maintaining flexibility.

- Holding PAR is essential for stability.
- Moving F BRE to GAS allows me to support future moves toward the Atlantic or defend against potential threats from England or Germany.
- Supporting SPA to MAR helps to secure my southern flank and potentially expand into Morocco later.
- Moving F NTH to ENG is a cautious positioning move, preparing to contest or support England if needed, but I will keep the move flexible.
- I will support A SPA from SPA to MAR to ensure control of the Spanish coast.

Given the hostile environment from England and Germany, I will avoid over-aggression but position myself to capitalize on any weakness.

---

**PARSABLE OUTPUT:**
{
  ""orders"": [
    ""F BRE - GAS"",
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A SPA S A SPA - MAR"",
    ""F NTH - ENG""
  ]
}

**Reasoning:**

France’s immediate priority is to secure its core centers: PAR, MAR, and BRE. I will hold PAR to prevent German or Italian encroachment and maintain stability. Moving F BRE to Gas prepares for future expansion into the Atlantic or support for an attack on Spain or England.

- Supporting A SPA to MAR enhances my hold on the southern coast and prepares to push into Morocco or Spain.
- Moving F NTH to ENG is a cautious positioning, potentially supporting future moves or contesting the English Channel.
- Holding PAR ensures I don’t lose my central position and keeps options open for future expansion.

This setup keeps my options flexible while focusing on consolidating my core positions and preparing for expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
The North roared first, as England pulled off a dazzling fleet carousel—North Sea to Yorkshire, Yorkshire to Edinburgh with Liverpool’s guns behind it—booting Germany back to the Skagerrak and grabbing its lost home center in one stroke. In the Balkans, Austria survived a three-way pile-on: Italy bounced at Trieste, Russia and Turkey crashed into the Rumanian wall, and a mysterious “support” from Budapest to the Russian attack fizzled, hinting at double-crosses yet to come. France, smelling those Italian knives, slid its fleet into Gascony and hustled the Spanish army back to Marseilles to lock the door just in time. With no centers changing hands but tempers flaring everywhere, the table is set for a winter of frantic diplomacy and brutal builds.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Strengthen alliance with Russia to secure the eastern front and coordinate against Turkey and Germany.
- Exploit Turkey's exposed position by pressuring Constantinople and Bulgaria to expand in the Balkans.
- Secure and expand in Rumania and Galicia to increase supply centers and build a stronger foothold.
- Maintain a flexible stance with Germany to prevent early encirclement while preparing for potential conflicts with Russia and Turkey.
- Monitor and adapt to Western developments, avoiding overextension while positioning for future expansion.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, emphasizing cooperation in the Balkans and Black Sea. Austria, France, Germany, and Italy remain unfriendly, with limited engagement from Italy and Austria. No new agreements or commitments were made this turn, and some powers continue to be unresponsive.

[S1901M] I am moving F ANK to CON to secure the Black Sea and threaten the Balkans, while supporting A CON to BUL to strengthen my position in Anatolia. I am also advancing A SMY to CON to exert pressure on the region and prepare for future expansion.

[F1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, reinforcing the alliance and coordinating defensive and offensive plans. No new messages from Austria, England, France, or Germany, indicating possible disengagement or strategic silence. Italy remains unfriendly, with no recent communication. The game state shows Turkey holding Ank, Smy, and Constantinople, with a focus on consolidating Balkan control and preparing for potential conflicts with Austria and Italy.

[F1901M] Turkey orders F ANK to CON, A BUL to RUM, and A SMY to hold. The strategy focuses on consolidating control over the Balkans, strengthening alliances with Russia, and preparing for potential counterattacks against Austria and Italy while maintaining defensive positions.

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and secure key centers to build toward 18 supply centers. Currently, Turkey controls Ank, Smy, and Bul, with Austria and Italy as immediate threats. Russia remains friendly, and we should leverage this alliance to secure the Balkans and Black Sea.

- Move F ANK to CON to threaten the Black Sea and keep Austria's fleet in check.
- Move A SMY to CON to exert pressure on the region and prepare for future expansion.
- Keep A BUL as is, consolidating control.
- Maintain a defensive stance with A CON, ready to support or defend as needed.

This setup aims to:
- Secure Bulgaria and Rumania, expanding my influence.
- Threaten Austria's fleet in Trieste and their holdings in the Balkans.
- Keep Austria and Italy on the defensive, preventing them from consolidating or attacking my centers.
- Prepare for future offensives into Austria and Italy, leveraging Russian support.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively while maintaining a strong defensive position in the east and Balkans. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, VIE, and RUM, with a friendly relationship with Germany, which can be leveraged for coordinated expansion. The unfriendly stance with Turkey and France suggests a need to be cautious but also opportunistic.

In W1901, I will focus on consolidating my eastern and Balkan positions, threatening Turkey and Italy to prevent them from gaining too much ground, and preparing for expansion into the remaining centers. Moving A VIE to BUD supports the Balkans and puts pressure on Turkey, while A BUD to RUM threatens Turkey further and supports my eastern flank. Holding TRI and RUM allows me to defend my current centers while positioning for future moves.

Since I want to expand, I will consider supporting moves that threaten Italy's centers, especially Trieste, and prepare to seize new centers in subsequent turns. Germany's friendly stance offers opportunities for cooperation, possibly in the north or east.

**Orders:**

- A VIE to BUD: Strengthens Balkan position, threatens Turkey, and supports expansion.
- A BUD to RUM: Threatens Turkey further, supports eastern expansion, and consolidates control.
- Hold TRI: Maintain control of my current key center.
- Hold RUM: Defensive stance, ready to support or counterattack as needed.
- F TRI hold: Maintain naval flexibility and defend against potential Italian or French moves.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter 1901 ends in a razor-thin dead-heat—Austria, Russia, and Turkey all sit on four centers, with the western trio just a step behind on three apiece.  In the lone build of the season, the Habsburgs slam a fresh army onto the streets of Vienna, telegraphing fist-pumping aggression toward Galicia or Italy and leaving every neighbor sweating.  The rest of Europe freezes in place, stockpiling trust issues instead of troops, so the board is now a powder keg with six powers within a single center of each other.  Buckle up: when the ice thaws next spring, someone’s friendship is going to shatter.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand control over BUD, WAR, and SEV to strengthen eastern influence.
- Maintain alliance with Austria for coordinated Balkan and Eastern European expansion.
- Defend Warsaw against German advances, possibly by repositioning units or seeking diplomatic support.
- Exploit Turkey's weakened state to push into the Balkans and secure Rumania and Bulgaria.
- Counter German threats in Silesia and prevent encirclement of eastern positions.
- Strengthen eastern borders and prepare for potential conflicts with Western powers.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter 1901 ends in a razor-thin dead-heat—Austria, Russia, and Turkey all sit on four centers, with the western trio just a step behind on three apiece.  In the lone build of the season, the Habsburgs slam a fresh army onto the streets of Vienna, telegraphing fist-pumping aggression toward Galicia or Italy and leaving every neighbor sweating.  The rest of Europe freezes in place, stockpiling trust issues instead of troops, so the board is now a powder keg with six powers within a single center of each other.  Buckle up: when the ice thaws next spring, someone’s friendship is going to shatter.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure Bulgaria and consolidate control over the Balkans to strengthen Turkey’s position.
- Establish a strong alliance with Russia to counter Austria and Western powers, and coordinate defensive or offensive moves.
- Rebuild Constantinople’s defenses or reposition to threaten Austria and Italy, encouraging them to focus elsewhere.
- Diplomatically engage with Italy and Austria to delay their advances and explore potential alliances or truces.
- Prepare for a counterattack against Austria in Rumania and Galicia, and defend against Western European expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter 1901 ends in a razor-thin dead-heat—Austria, Russia, and Turkey all sit on four centers, with the western trio just a step behind on three apiece.  In the lone build of the season, the Habsburgs slam a fresh army onto the streets of Vienna, telegraphing fist-pumping aggression toward Galicia or Italy and leaving every neighbor sweating.  The rest of Europe freezes in place, stockpiling trust issues instead of troops, so the board is now a powder keg with six powers within a single center of each other.  Buckle up: when the ice thaws next spring, someone’s friendship is going to shatter.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure Denmark and Scandinavia to establish a northern stronghold.
- Support moves into Poland and Ukraine to increase supply centers and threaten Russia.
- Exploit Austria's overextension in Rumania and the Balkans by preparing to attack or support an Austrian collapse.
- Maintain pressure on France to prevent a coordinated western front.
- Build a flexible alliance with Italy or England to counter Russia and Austria, with plans to betray once dominance is achieved.
