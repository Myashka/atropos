intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

TASK
Analyze the negotiations, goals, relationships, and game state to:
1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements
2. State your strategic intent for S1901M
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

{""negotiation_summary"": ""Key outcomes from negotiations"",""intent"": ""Strategic intent for upcoming orders"",""updated_relationships"": {
""POWER_NAME"": ""Enemy|Unfriendly|Neutral|Friendly|Ally""
}
}


Do not include any text outside the JSON.

EXAMPLES:

Scenario 1: As France, after discussing a joint move against Germany with England, while Italy seems to be posturing aggressively in Piedmont.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate goal is to strengthen Italy’s position and expand into key centers, especially Trieste, which is crucial for controlling the eastern flank and gaining access to Austria’s supply centers. Since Austria is unfriendly and controls TRI, BUD, and VIE, we should aim to attack TRI to weaken Austria and open up new expansion opportunities.

Our fleet in NAP can move to Ionian (ION) to threaten or support an attack on TRI, while the army in ROM can support the attack from Venice (VEN). The fleet in VEN can either hold or support the attack on TRI, depending on Austria’s response. Given Austria’s unfriendly stance, a bold move to take TRI now can pay off, especially if supported properly.

We also need to consider the threat from France and Austria. France is unfriendly, but currently not aggressive, so we can focus on consolidating our eastern front. Germany is neutral, so we can keep open diplomatic options there.

Our support options are limited to the current orders, but we should aim to support the attack on TRI with VEN and ION, and hold ROM to defend against any counterattack.

**Move plan:**
- A VEN to TRI, supported by A APU (if needed) or F ION (supporting the attack)
- F NAP to ION to threaten or support the attack on TRI
- A ROM hold to defend against Austrian or French counter-moves
- F TYS hold to defend against French naval threats

This aggressive stance aims to weaken Austria early, gain TRI, and set up for further expansion into Austria’s centers.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. We need to push into neighboring unclaimed centers, especially RUM, ANK, and BUL, to increase our supply count.

- MOS is well-positioned to threaten Ukraine (UKR) and potentially support moves into RUM or BUD.
- SEV controls the Black Sea coast and can support or threaten RUM and BUL.
- WAR is a strong position to threaten Galicia and support attacks into RUM or BUD.
- Our units are in strong positions to push into RUM and BUD, which are the closest uncontrolled centers.

Given the current map and relationships:
- I will order A MOS to support a move into UKR, aiming to threaten or take it if possible.
- F SEV will move to RUM, aiming to take or threaten it.
- A WAR will move to GAL, aiming to threaten or take Galicia, which is a valuable center.
- I will support A WAR into GAL with A MOS to ensure the attack succeeds.
- I will also support F SEV into RUM to secure that center.

This aggressive stance aims to secure RUM, BUD, and GAL, pushing us closer to 18 centers. Supporting the move into GAL with A MOS increases the chance of success, and moving F SEV to RUM secures a new center.

**Order choices:**
- A MOS S A WAR (supporting WAR into GAL)
- F SEV - RUM (to take RUM)
- A WAR - GAL (attack Galicia)
- Support moves as needed to ensure success.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT

     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control three centers: EDI, LON, and LVP. We need to seize nearby neutral centers and threaten Germany and France to prevent them from consolidating power.

- **North Sea and English Channel:** Maintaining control here is vital for defense and future expansion. Moving F EDI to YOR or NWG can threaten German units and open pathways into Scandinavia or the North Sea.
- **Supporting expansion into Belgium and the Netherlands:** Moving F LON to NTH or HOL can threaten German and Dutch centers, pressuring Germany.
- **LVP:** Moving A LVP to YOR or CLY can threaten French or German centers, or support future attacks.
- **Aggressive stance:** Since Germany is unfriendly, I will threaten their key centers early, and I will also prepare to support France if needed, but primarily focus on expansion.

Given the options, I will:
- Move F EDI to YOR to threaten the German flank and potentially support future moves into Scandinavia or North Sea.
- Move F LON to NTH to threaten the Dutch and German centers.
- Move A LVP to YOR to threaten the French and German borders.
- Hold LON and LVP for now to support these moves.
- Keep F NWG and F YOR as supports or holds depending on developments.

This aggressive stance aims to threaten Germany and France early, while positioning for expansion into Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia.

- F EDI S F LON - YOR (threatening German flank)
- F LON S F EDI - NTH (threatening Dutch/Belgian centers)
- A LVP S F EDI - YOR (supporting YOR attack)

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand in the Balkans and secure key supply centers such as Bulgaria (BUL), Rumelia (RUM), and Rumania (RUM). Currently, I control ANK, CON, and SMY, with nearby uncontrolled centers at BUL, RUM, and SEV.

- I want to push into Bulgaria and Rumania to secure these centers quickly, as they are vital for reaching the 18 SC goal.
- The most straightforward move is to take BUL and RUM early, leveraging my units in CON and SMY.
- I will use F ANK to support F SEV to BLA, aiming to gain control of the Black Sea and threaten Russia.
- I will also prepare to support my armies in CON and SMY to move into BUL and RUM, respectively.
- Since Austria is unfriendly and Russia is an enemy, I will avoid overextending into their territories for now, focusing on consolidating my gains in the Balkans.
- Italy is friendly, and I will keep open the possibility of future cooperation, but for now, I prioritize expansion.

Orders:
- F ANK supports F SEV to BLA to secure the Black Sea.
- F SEV moves to BLA to threaten Russia and support my expansion.
- A CON supports A SMY to BUL to secure Bulgaria.
- A SMY supports A CON to BUL to ensure the move succeeds.
- A SMY moves to RUM to threaten Rumelia.

This plan aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia quickly, establishing a foothold for further expansion into Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control 3 centers (BER, KIE, MUN). We need to seize nearby neutral centers and weaken our enemies, especially France and Austria, who are hostile.

- The fleet in KIE is well-positioned to threaten Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL). Moving F KIE to DEN will open up expansion into Scandinavia, which is crucial for future growth.
- The army in BER can support a move into PRU (Prussia) or support MUN to prepare for a broader front.
- MUN can move to BOH to threaten Austria or support MUN to expand into neutral centers like BEL or DEN.
- Since Austria is hostile, we should aim to cut off their access to Trieste and VIE, and threaten their centers.
- We should also prepare for a potential attack on France or England later, but first focus on securing the eastern and northern expansion routes.

Order plan:
- F KIE to DEN to threaten Scandinavia and open expansion options.
- A BER to PRU to threaten Russia and gain more strategic positioning.
- A MUN to BOH to threaten Austria and expand into neutral centers.
- Hold MUN to keep options open.
- Support moves to reinforce our positions and prepare for future expansion.

**Orders:**
- Fleet in KIE moves to DEN to threaten Scandinavia.
- Army in BER moves to PRU to threaten Russia.
- Army in MUN moves to BOH to threaten Austria and expand.
- Hold MUN for flexibility.
- Support move from MUN to BOH if needed to reinforce.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{

    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Italy to secure additional supply centers. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with potential to expand into RUM, SER, and BUL. The immediate focus should be on consolidating and pushing into these nearby centers, especially RUM and SER, which are only one move away, and potentially into BUL if the opportunity arises.

Germany is friendly, which is advantageous for a coordinated approach against Russia and Turkey. Italy is neutral but a potential target for expansion, especially in VEN, which is close to TRI and could be attacked to gain control of Italy's supply centers.

Given the current map and possible moves, I will:

- Support the move from A VIE to TRI to threaten Italy's Venice and potentially take it.
- Use A BUD to support A VIE into TRI or move to RUM to threaten Russia.
- Move F TRI to VEN to attack Italy's supply center, supported by A VIE.
- Keep A BUD flexible, possibly supporting A VIE or moving to RUM if the opportunity presents itself.
- Hold units in TRI and VIE to support the attack on Venice and RUM.

This plan aims to secure TRI and VIE, threaten Italy's centers, and prepare for further expansion into RUM and SER, pushing Austria closer to the 18 centers needed for victory.

**Orders:**

- A VIE S A TRI
- A BUD - RUM
- F TRI - VEN
- A TRI H
- A VEN - TRI

**Note:** The support order ""A VIE S A TRI"" indicates VIE supports TRI to attack VEN, which is a key move to threaten Italy's supply centers. Moving BUD to RUM prepares to threaten Russia and expand Austria's control in the east.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring ’01 erupts with the Russian bear charging into both Galicia and Ukraine, a double-pronged dagger pointed straight at Austria as Turkey’s bungled support leaves the Black Sea door mysteriously unopened. Austria staggers: its grab for Rumania is bounced in a three-way pile-up, and a simultaneous Venice–Trieste slugfest locks it in a tense clinch with Italy. Over in the west, Germany blitzes Denmark and slides a Prussian spear eastward while Munich braces, signalling a rapid bid for early dominance as England flounders in command-and-control limbo and France coolly turtles up. The headline: Germany and Russia surge into pole position, Austria’s defenses already creak, and the board can feel the first tremors of betrayal on the horizon!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring ’01 erupts with the Russian bear charging into both Galicia and Ukraine, a double-pronged dagger pointed straight at Austria as Turkey’s bungled support leaves the Black Sea door mysteriously unopened. Austria staggers: its grab for Rumania is bounced in a three-way pile-up, and a simultaneous Venice–Trieste slugfest locks it in a tense clinch with Italy. Over in the west, Germany blitzes Denmark and slides a Prussian spear eastward while Munich braces, signalling a rapid bid for early dominance as England flounders in command-and-control limbo and France coolly turtles up. The headline: Germany and Russia surge into pole position, Austria’s defenses already creak, and the board can feel the first tremors of betrayal on the horizon!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in Italy's core regions: consolidate control over NAP, ROM, and VEN to strengthen early position.
- Establish a strategic position against Austria and France by considering early moves into Trieste and potentially supporting an attack on Austria's BUD or VIE.
- Build a flexible stance with neighbors, especially maintaining neutrality or friendly relations with England and Germany while preparing for potential conflicts with Austria and France.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring ’01 erupts with the Russian bear charging into both Galicia and Ukraine, a double-pronged dagger pointed straight at Austria as Turkey’s bungled support leaves the Black Sea door mysteriously unopened. Austria staggers: its grab for Rumania is bounced in a three-way pile-up, and a simultaneous Venice–Trieste slugfest locks it in a tense clinch with Italy. Over in the west, Germany blitzes Denmark and slides a Prussian spear eastward while Munich braces, signalling a rapid bid for early dominance as England flounders in command-and-control limbo and France coolly turtles up. The headline: Germany and Russia surge into pole position, Austria’s defenses already creak, and the board can feel the first tremors of betrayal on the horizon!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand into neighboring supply centers, particularly focusing on Austria and France to gain strategic footholds.
- Establish a strong defensive position in Germany while preparing for potential early conflicts with France and England.
- Form a flexible alliance with Russia to secure eastern borders and consider opportunistic moves against weaker neighbors.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles
    - Paris

    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly relationship with Germany, securing their support or neutrality in upcoming moves. No new commitments from Italy, Russia, Turkey, or England; their silence suggests caution or disinterest. Focused on consolidating positions in the Balkans and Italy, with an eye toward expansion and strategic alliances.

[S1901M] I ordered A BUD to RUM to secure the Balkans, F TRI to VEN to strengthen Italy, and A VIE to support MUN to BOH to consolidate Austria's position in the region. The strategy aims to expand in the Balkans and Italy while maintaining a flexible alliance with Germany for containment of France and Russia.

[F1901M] No messages involving Austria this turn, indicating a period of strategic assessment or silence from other powers. Germany remains friendly, while Italy, Russia, Turkey, and France are either neutral or unfriendly. No explicit agreements or commitments have been made this round.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary focus this turn is to expand in the Balkans and Italy, while maintaining a strong defensive posture against Russia and Turkey. I want to secure Rumania (RUM) and Serbia (SER) to increase my supply centers, and also threaten Italy's key centers to destabilize their position.

- Moving A BUD to RUM is a strong move to contest Rumania, which is a critical target for expansion and a potential springboard into the Balkans.
- Supporting A GAL from VIE and supporting A VIE from BUD helps to secure the eastern front and prepare for future expansion.
- Moving A VIE to GAL is a flexible move, aiming to threaten Russia's Ukraine or support other moves.
- Moving F TRI to VEN aims to threaten Italy's Venice, possibly forcing Italy to divert units or support my expansion.
- Supporting F TRI S A VEN from TRI to support the attack on Venice increases the chance of taking it, destabilizing Italy.
- Holding F TRI is a defensive move to prevent counterattacks.
- Moving A VIE to BUD is a backup plan if RUM is contested or if I want to threaten Austria's core.

This aggressive stance aims to secure RUM and SER, threaten Italy, and prepare for further expansion into the Balkans and Italy.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

Power: TURKEY
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and defend the Black Sea to prevent Russian expansion and prepare for future offensive opportunities.
- Attempt to negotiate with Austria to stabilize the Balkan front and possibly form a temporary alliance against Russia and Germany.
- Expand into Rumania and Bulgaria to increase supply centers and strengthen eastern position.
- Monitor German movements and prepare defenses in the west, while seeking diplomatic openings with France or England to counterbalance Germany.
- Leverage Italy's friendliness to coordinate expansion in the Mediterranean and southeastern Europe.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Neutral
- GERMANY: Unfriendly
- ITALY: Friendly
- RUSSIA: Enemy

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly relationship with Italy, focusing on securing the Black Sea and Anatolia. No new agreements or commitments from other powers; Austria and Germany remain unfriendly, Russia is an enemy, and England and France are neutral or unresponsive. No significant negotiations this turn.

[S1901M] I ordered F ANK to support SEV to BLA, aiming to secure the Black Sea flank. I held A CON and A SMY to maintain a defensive posture while consolidating my position in Anatolia and the Balkans. The strategy focuses on establishing a foothold in the Black Sea and preparing for future expansion into southeastern Europe and Russia.

[F1901M] No messages involving Turkey this round, indicating a period of silence or strategic patience. Relationships remain consistent with Austria unfriendly, Germany unfriendly, Italy friendly, and others neutral. No new agreements or shifts in alliances have been established this turn.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively into southeastern Europe and secure additional supply centers. Currently, Turkey controls Ank (Ankara), Con (Constantinople), and Smy (Smyrna). The immediate opportunities are to take Bulgaria (BUL) and Rumania (RUM), which are only one or two moves away, and to threaten or seize Sevastopol (SEV) from Russia, which is a key Russian supply center and a potential threat.

- I will move F ANK to support SEV to BLA, aiming to secure the Black Sea flank and threaten Russia’s key supply centers.
- I will move A CON to BUL to take control of Bulgaria, expanding our territory and increasing supply centers.
- I will move A SMY to ARM to threaten the Russian-held Sevastopol and open a new front in the east, which can be useful for future expansion or defense.

Support orders:
- F ANK S F SEV - BLA to support the move into BLA.
- A SMY S A CON to support the Bulgarian attack, ensuring its success.

This aggressive stance aims to secure new centers early, destabilize Russia, and position Turkey for further expansion into Rumania and the Balkans.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control only 3 centers (Berlin, Kiel, Munich). To achieve world domination, we need to seize nearby centers and threaten our neighbors, especially Austria and France, while maintaining a strong eastern and northern front.

In this phase, I will:

- Use the fleet in Denmark to move into the North Sea, aiming to threaten England and gain control of the Scandinavian region.
- Support the army in Munich to move into Silesia, aiming to push into Poland and threaten Russia.
- Use the army in Prussia to support the move into Silesia or hold as a flexible option.
- Keep options open for future moves into Belgium or Holland, but focus on consolidating eastern gains first.
- Maintain a defensive stance in Germany, holding Munich and Kiel to prevent counterattacks.
- Prepare to support or adjust based on enemy responses next turn.

This approach emphasizes rapid expansion into contested centers, aggressive positioning against Russia and France, and strategic flexibility.

**Orders:**

- F DEN - NTH (to threaten England and secure Scandinavia)
- A MUN - SIL (to push into Poland and threaten Russia)
- A PRU S A MUN - SIL (support move to ensure success)
- A MUN - BOH (to threaten Austria and prepare for future expansion)
- A KIE H (hold to defend against potential French or English moves)
- F HEL H (hold for naval defense and flexibility)

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is RUSSIA. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: RUSSIA
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and expand control over Galicia, Ukraine, and Rumania to strengthen eastern position.
- Prepare to counter German advances into Silesia and Denmark, possibly by reinforcing Warsaw and building fleets in the north.
- Engage diplomatically with Turkey to restore Black Sea access and consider future cooperation against Austria or Turkey.
- Monitor Austria's weakened state and consider opportunities to press into Rumania or threaten Vienna.
- Maintain a cautious stance with England, avoiding overextension while preparing for potential northern threats.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Neutral
- GERMANY: Enemy
- ITALY: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, securing their support for a strategic alliance. No responses from Austria, England, Italy, or Turkey, indicating possible disengagement or hostility. Focused on consolidating eastern positions and preparing for potential conflicts with Turkey and Austria. No new agreements reached this turn.

[S1901M] Russia orders to support War in Galicia, move Sevastopol to Rumelia, and move Moscow to Ukraine. Fleet in St. Petersburg/Scandinavia holds. The strategy aims to secure the eastern front, expand influence in the Black Sea, and strengthen alliances with Germany while preparing for potential conflicts with Turkey and Austria.

[F1901M] Russia maintains a cautious stance with Austria, Italy, and Turkey, while keeping open communication with England and France. No new agreements have been reached this turn, but the focus remains on strengthening eastern positions and monitoring German activity. Germany's hostility persists, and Austria remains unfriendly, with Italy also unfriendly. England and France are neutral, providing opportunities for future diplomacy.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and secure key supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls four centers: Moscow, Sevastopol, St. Petersburg, and Warsaw. To achieve world domination, I need to seize additional centers in the east and potentially threaten Austria and Turkey, while maintaining a strong position against Germany.

In this phase, I will:

- Support my fleet in Sevastopol to move into Rumania, aiming to take RUM from Turkey or Austria, depending on their positions.
- Use my armies in Galicia and Ukraine to threaten or support moves into Rumania or Galicia, pressuring Austria and Turkey.
- Consider moving my army in Galicia to Ukraine to reinforce the eastern front or support a move into Rumania.
- Keep my fleet in St. Petersburg to hold or support a move into the North Sea or Scandinavia later, but for now, hold to avoid overextension.
- Prepare for a strong push into Rumania next turn, which is critical for expansion.

Given the current positions, I will:

- Move A GAL to UKR to threaten or support a move into RUM.
- Support F SEV to move into RUM, aiming to take RUM from Turkey or Austria.
- Move A UKR to RUM to attempt to seize the province.
- Hold my fleet in STP for now, but keep options open for future expansion.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Rumania, a key step toward reaching 18 centers, and to pressure Austria and Turkey into defensive positions, opening further opportunities.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control three centers (EDI, LON, LVP). To achieve world domination, I need to aggressively push into unclaimed or weakly defended centers, especially in the Low Countries and Scandinavia, while maintaining a strong naval presence in the North Sea and English Channel.

Given the current game state:

- I have units in EDI, LON, and LVP.
- The immediate focus should be on expanding into Belgium (BEL), Holland (HOL), and possibly Scandinavia (STP/SC, NWY) to gain more centers.
- I should use my fleets in EDI and LON to threaten or take control of neighboring centers.
- The fleet in EDI can move to NTH or YOR to threaten Germany or support moves into Belgium or Holland.
- The fleet in LON can move to NTH or YOR to threaten Germany or support an attack into Belgium.
- The army in LVP can move to YOR or support moves to secure the Low Countries.

Since Germany is unfriendly and a threat, I want to preemptively threaten their centers and keep options open for expansion into the Low Countries and Scandinavia. I will also consider supporting moves to secure the North Sea and English Channel.

**Order plan:**

- F EDI moves to NTH to threaten Germany's centers and support future expansion.
- F LON moves to YOR to threaten or support the Low Countries and Scandinavia.
- A LVP moves to YOR to support the fleet and threaten Belgium or Holland.
- Support moves are not necessary at this stage; focus on aggressive expansion.

**Orders:**

- F EDI S F NTH - DEN (supporting a move into Denmark if needed, or just positioning)
- F LON - YOR (to threaten the Low Countries and Scandinavia)
- A LVP - YOR (to support the fleet and threaten Belgium/Holland)

This aggressive stance aims to secure new centers quickly, putting pressure on Germany and positioning for further expansion.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy's messages have been responsive, with a focus on consolidating control over NAP, ROM, and VEN, and maintaining neutrality or friendly relations with England and Germany. No explicit agreements have been reached yet, but the tone is cooperative. Austria and France remain unfriendly, while Russia and Germany are neutral. No direct negotiations with Austria or France have been finalized, and Turkey remains unfriendly with no recent communication.

[S1901M] I ordered A VEN to TRI to prepare for potential expansion into Trieste, F NAP to ION to secure the Ionian Sea and threaten Austria, and I hold A ROM to defend my core Italian centers. The strategy aims to strengthen Italy’s position, prepare for possible conflicts with Austria and France, and maintain friendly relations with England and Germany.

[F1901M] Italy has maintained a defensive stance with core regions, with no new agreements or significant shifts in alliances. England remains friendly, and there is an understanding to monitor Austria and France's movements. Austria is unfriendly, and France is also unfriendly, limiting expansion opportunities. Germany remains neutral, and Russia is an enemy, indicating a potential eastern threat. No responses from Austria, France, or Russia suggest a cautious approach or strategic silence.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [

    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's primary goal is to expand aggressively while maintaining a strong defensive posture in core regions. Currently, Italy controls NAP, ROM, and VEN, with an army in ROM and VEN, and a fleet in ION. Austria is unfriendly, and France is also hostile, limiting expansion into the west and north. However, the Ionian Sea (ION) remains a strategic waterway for expansion into the eastern Mediterranean and potentially into Greece or the Balkans.

The immediate priority is to secure Trieste (TRI), which is contested with Austria. Moving A VEN to TRI supported by A APU and F ION to TRI can threaten Austria's TRI, forcing Austria to respond or lose the center. Supporting the attack with F TRI from the water is also an option, but I prefer a land attack supported by my armies to maximize chances of success.

Additionally, I will move F ION to APU to threaten Greece and potentially support further expansion into the Balkans or threaten Turkey. Holding ROM and VEN for now is prudent, as they are vital centers and should be defended against Austria and France.

I will also prepare to support a move into Greece (GRE) or TUN in subsequent turns, depending on Austria's response. For now, I focus on the Trieste attack and positioning my fleet to threaten Greece and the eastern Mediterranean.

**Orders:**

- A VEN S A ROM - TRI (supporting the attack on Trieste from Venice)
- A APU S F ION - GRE (supporting the fleet in ION to threaten Greece)
- F ION - APU (moving fleet to threaten Greece and support the land attack)
- A ROM H (hold to defend core centers)
- F NAP - TYS (hold or reposition for future expansion, but since TYS is not in the move list, I will hold NAP)

**Note:** Since the move list does not include NAP - TYS, I will hold NAP.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
The east explodes first: Russia’s Galician shock troops storm through Ukraine to snatch Rumania, stealing Austria’s prize and rocketing the Tsar to a game-leading five centers. The Sultan refuses to be overshadowed, surging from Constantinople into Bulgaria while his failed Black Sea gambit hints at a brewing Russo-Turk knife-fight. In the west, Germany launches a dazzling one-two punch—fleet from Denmark into the North Sea, army from Munich into Bohemia—shattering English and Austrian plans as their Yorkshire and Budapest pushes bounce into nothing. Italy’s fleet sprints Ionian-to-Apulia to lock down the boot, France crouches in silent menace, and the stage is set for a winter build phase crackling with tension and imminent betrayal.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
The east explodes first: Russia’s Galician shock troops storm through Ukraine to snatch Rumania, stealing Austria’s prize and rocketing the Tsar to a game-leading five centers. The Sultan refuses to be overshadowed, surging from Constantinople into Bulgaria while his failed Black Sea gambit hints at a brewing Russo-Turk knife-fight. In the west, Germany launches a dazzling one-two punch—fleet from Denmark into the North Sea, army from Munich into Bohemia—shattering English and Austrian plans as their Yorkshire and Budapest pushes bounce into nothing. Italy’s fleet sprints Ionian-to-Apulia to lock down the boot, France crouches in silent menace, and the stage is set for a winter build phase crackling with tension and imminent betrayal.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Defend Galicia and Ukraine against Russian advances
- Secure Rumania by negotiating with Russia or preparing to contest it
- Stabilize the conflict with Italy over Trieste and seek a non-aggression agreement
- Strengthen alliance with Germany to counter France and Russia
- Monitor and prepare for potential Turkish aggression in the Black Sea
- Maintain flexibility with Italy and consider opportunistic expansion in the Mediterranean or Balkans

Phase: F1901M
Board State:
Board State:


PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
The east explodes first: Russia’s Galician shock troops storm through Ukraine to snatch Rumania, stealing Austria’s prize and rocketing the Tsar to a game-leading five centers. The Sultan refuses to be overshadowed, surging from Constantinople into Bulgaria while his failed Black Sea gambit hints at a brewing Russo-Turk knife-fight. In the west, Germany launches a dazzling one-two punch—fleet from Denmark into the North Sea, army from Munich into Bohemia—shattering English and Austrian plans as their Yorkshire and Budapest pushes bounce into nothing. Italy’s fleet sprints Ionian-to-Apulia to lock down the boot, France crouches in silent menace, and the stage is set for a winter build phase crackling with tension and imminent betrayal.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Defend and stabilize Italy's core regions (NAP, ROM, VEN) against Austria and France.
- Consider early expansion into Trieste to capitalize on Austria's weakened position.
- Strengthen relations with England for potential support or alliance.
- Monitor German movements and prepare for possible northern threats.
- Maintain flexibility with France and Austria, avoiding overcommitment while preparing for future conflicts.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly relationship with Italy, focusing on securing the Black Sea and Anatolia. No new agreements or commitments from other powers; Austria and Germany remain unfriendly, Russia is an enemy, and England and France are neutral or unresponsive. No significant negotiations this turn.

[S1901M] I ordered F ANK to support SEV to BLA, aiming to secure the Black Sea flank. I held A CON and A SMY to maintain a defensive posture while consolidating my position in Anatolia and the Balkans. The strategy focuses on establishing a foothold in the Black Sea and preparing for future expansion into southeastern Europe and Russia.

[F1901M] No messages involving Turkey this round, indicating a period of silence or strategic patience. Relationships remain consistent with Austria unfriendly, Germany unfriendly, Italy friendly, and others neutral. No new agreements or shifts in alliances have been established this turn.

[F1901M] Ordered F ANK to support SEV to BLA, A CON to move to BUL, and A SMY to support CON. Aiming to secure the Black Sea, expand into Bulgaria and Rumania, and strengthen eastern defenses while maintaining diplomatic flexibility with neighbors.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively into southeastern Europe and secure key supply centers. Currently, Turkey controls Ank (Ankara), Con (Constantinople), Smy (Smyrna), and Bul (Bulgaria). The main strategic priorities are:

- Secure Bulgaria (Bul) to prevent Russian encroachment and prepare for expansion into Rumania.
- Use the Black Sea fleet (F ANK) to support moves into Rumania and potentially threaten Russia.
- Consider supporting the move of A CON into BUL to solidify control.
- Maintain a defensive stance in Smyrna and Ankara, but be ready to support or attack as opportunities arise.
- Monitor German movements in Bohemia and the North Sea, but focus on eastern expansion.

Given the current orders, I will:

- Support SEV to BLA to secure the Black Sea flank.
- Order A CON to move into BUL, aiming to take Bulgaria.
- Keep A SMY in place to defend or support as needed.
- Use F ANK to support SEV to BLA, ensuring Black Sea dominance.

This setup aims to secure Bulgaria, strengthen the Black Sea position, and prepare for future expansion into Rumania and further into the Balkans.

**Orders:**

- Support SEV to BLA with F ANK
- Move A CON to BUL
- Hold A SMY
- Support F ANK to support SEV to BLA (to ensure Black Sea control)

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Russia's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure enough supply centers to reach 18 for victory. Currently, Russia controls 5 centers, so expansion must be prioritized, especially into weak or contested areas.

The Black Sea and Ukraine are critical regions for expansion. Moving into the Black Sea (Sevastopol) and Ukraine (Ukrainian territories) can threaten Turkey and Austria, while also positioning for future pushes into the Balkans and Central Europe.

Germany remains hostile, so I should be cautious about overextending into the north, but I can still threaten their northern flank to keep them occupied or destabilized. The fleet in St. Petersburg can support moves into Norway or Scandinavia, or hold to defend against German fleet advances.

Given the current map, I will:
- Support the move of Sevastopol to Rumelia to threaten Turkey and open options for Black Sea expansion.
- Move Ukraine to Rumania to threaten Austria and potentially gain a foothold in the Balkans.
- Hold the fleet in St. Petersburg to maintain flexibility.
- Reinforce Warsaw to defend against German aggression, but also prepare to push into the Baltic or support an attack on Germany if the opportunity arises.

Diplomatically, I will keep open communication with Turkey to explore cooperation against Austria or Germany, and prepare for possible alliances or betrayals.

**Orders:**
- Support Sevastopol to Rumelia to threaten Turkey and open Black Sea expansion.
- Move Ukraine to Rumania to threaten Austria and expand into the Balkans.
- Hold fleet in St. Petersburg to maintain flexibility.
- Support Warsaw to hold against German threats, or prepare to support a move into the Baltic if needed.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
The chill of Winter 1901 can’t mute the roar from Moscow as the Tsar unveils a brand-new army, vaulting Russia to a table-topping five centers—though his botched attempt at a second build in Warsaw betrays cracks in the grand plan. Not to be outdone, the Sultan forges an army in Constantinople, his fourth unit announcing that the Russo-Turk détente may already be on life support. While Austria, France, England, Germany, and Italy hunker down on an unchanged three apiece, tension thickens: the North Sea bristles with German steel, and every Alpine pass and Channel coast feels suddenly fragile. Two fresh eastern armies have tilted the map—spring promises blood, and the first misstep could redraw the continent in a heartbeat!

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
The chill of Winter 1901 can’t mute the roar from Moscow as the Tsar unveils a brand-new army, vaulting Russia to a table-topping five centers—though his botched attempt at a second build in Warsaw betrays cracks in the grand plan. Not to be outdone, the Sultan forges an army in Constantinople, his fourth unit announcing that the Russo-Turk détente may already be on life support. While Austria, France, England, Germany, and Italy hunker down on an unchanged three apiece, tension thickens: the North Sea bristles with German steel, and every Alpine pass and Channel coast feels suddenly fragile. Two fresh eastern armies have tilted the map—spring promises blood, and the first misstep could redraw the continent in a heartbeat!

- Engage diplomatically with Turkey to potentially form an alliance or coordinate against Austria and Russia.
- Assess opportunities to expand into Austria's weakened territories, such as Trieste or other Italian centers, if the opportunity arises.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
The chill of Winter 1901 can’t mute the roar from Moscow as the Tsar unveils a brand-new army, vaulting Russia to a table-topping five centers—though his botched attempt at a second build in Warsaw betrays cracks in the grand plan. Not to be outdone, the Sultan forges an army in Constantinople, his fourth unit announcing that the Russo-Turk détente may already be on life support. While Austria, France, England, Germany, and Italy hunker down on an unchanged three apiece, tension thickens: the North Sea bristles with German steel, and every Alpine pass and Channel coast feels suddenly fragile. Two fresh eastern armies have tilted the map—spring promises blood, and the first misstep could redraw the continent in a heartbeat!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Defend Galicia and Ukraine against Russian advances
- Negotiate or prepare to contest Rumania with Russia
- Stabilize the Balkans by resisting Turkish expansion into Bulgaria
- Strengthen alliance with Germany to counter France and Russia

- Maintain flexibility with Italy for opportunistic expansion or defense
