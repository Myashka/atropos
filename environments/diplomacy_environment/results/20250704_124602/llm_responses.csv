gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for GERMANY in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",

  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in Western Europe and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control London, Edinburgh, and Liverpool, giving us 3 centers. We need to seize opportunities to expand into Belgium, the North Sea, and potentially threaten France and Germany.

- **Focus on the North Sea and Belgium:**
  Moving F EDI to NTH will threaten German and Dutch centers, and potentially support future moves into Belgium or the North Sea.
  - F EDI → NTH: This move puts pressure on Germany and prepares for expansion into Belgium.
  - F LON → YOR: Moving fleet to YOR secures the coast and prepares to support or move into the North Sea or Belgium.

- **Support and Defensive Posture:**
  - F LON supports F EDI to NTH, reinforcing the attack on Germany.
  - F EDI supports F LON to YOR, ensuring YOR is secured and can support future moves.

- **Potential for Future Expansion:**
  - If Germany or France weakens, we can pivot to take Belgium, Holland, or even the English Channel.
  - Maintaining flexibility with support orders keeps options open.

- **Diplomatic considerations:**
  - No messages are recorded, but we should keep communication open with France and Russia to avoid early conflicts and possibly secure their neutrality or support.

**Orders:**

- F EDI → NTH (threatening Germany and preparing for expansion into Belgium)
- F LON supports F EDI → NTH (reinforcing the attack)
- F LON → YOR (securing the coast and supporting future moves)

This setup maximizes aggressive expansion while maintaining flexibility and support.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, focusing on consolidating the Balkans and Italy. No new agreements reached with other powers; England, France, Russia, and Turkey remain unresponsive or hostile. Italy remains neutral, providing potential for expansion in the south. No significant shifts in relationships; silent powers may be assessing their options.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand Austria’s control of supply centers, especially in the Balkans and Italy, to reach 18 centers. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with RUM, SER, and BUL as the nearest uncontrolled centers. Our immediate focus should be on securing RUM and SER, as they are just one move away and provide critical expansion points.

Germany is friendly, which is advantageous; we can coordinate with them to contain France and Russia. Italy remains neutral but is a potential target for expansion in the south, especially if Italy becomes overextended or distracted.

Our units are positioned well for aggressive expansion:
- A BUD can move to RUM or SER.
- A VIE can threaten or support moves into GAL or TRI.
- F TRI can support or attack VEN or move to support expansion into Italy.

Given the current map and options, I will:
- Move A BUD to RUM to secure a new supply center.
- Support A VIE to move into GAL, aiming to threaten or take control of that region.
- Move F TRI to support A VEN attacking TRI, or alternatively, hold to prepare for future moves.
- Hold A VIE to maintain flexibility.
- Support A VEN to attack TRI, aiming to take it from Italy, which is a key step toward expansion.

This aggressive stance aims to secure RUM and GAL quickly, while also putting pressure on Italy to distract them from their expansion efforts. Supporting A VEN into TRI is a calculated move to gain a valuable center and weaken Italy.

**Orders:**
- A BUD S A VIE - GAL
- A VIE S A BUD - RUM
- F TRI S A VEN - TRI
- A VEN - TRI
- A ROM H

This plan aims to secure RUM and GAL, threaten TRI, and prepare for further expansion in subsequent turns.

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Italy controls Naples, Rome, and Venice. To achieve world domination, we need to seize nearby centers and threaten Austria, France, and potentially Turkey and Russia.

In this phase, I will:

- Use the fleet in Naples to threaten Ionian and Aegean regions, aiming to take control of Greece (e.g., Greece or Bulgaria) in subsequent turns.
- Move the fleet from Naples to Ionian Sea to support future attacks on Greece or to threaten Turkey.
- Use the armies in Rome and Venice to push into Trieste and potentially Buda or other Austrian-controlled centers, applying pressure on Austria.
- Support the move from Rome to Venice to consolidate control and prepare for future expansion.
- Keep units on hold or support as needed to maintain flexibility and respond to diplomatic developments.

Since no messages indicate immediate threats, I will focus on expanding into Greece and the Balkans, which are critical for reaching 18 centers.

**Orders:**

- F NAP - ION (to threaten Greece and open expansion options)
- F ION - AEG (to support the attack on Greece or threaten Turkey)
- A ROM - TRI (to threaten Austria's Trieste)
- A VEN - BUD (to threaten Austria's Buda and expand into the Balkans)
- F TYS H (hold for now, maintaining flexibility)

This plan aims to secure Greece, threaten Austria's centers, and position for further expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls four centers: MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. To achieve world domination, we need to seize nearby uncontrolled centers and threaten our enemies, especially Turkey and Austria, while maintaining a strong alliance with Germany.

- **Focus on the Black Sea and Ukraine:**
  Moving A MOS to UKR can threaten Austria and open up access to RUM, which is only two moves away. Supporting A WAR to move south into RUM or BUD could be advantageous, but given the current options, moving A MOS to UKR is a good step to threaten Austria's flank and prepare for future expansion.

- **Black Sea Operations:**
  F SEV should support a move to BLA or ARM to threaten Turkey's holdings and open up options for Black Sea expansion. Moving F SEV to ARM or BLA can threaten Turkey's coast and support future attacks.

- **Support and Defense:**
  Holding units in WAR and SEV for now to maintain control and prepare for future offensives.

- **Support from Germany:**
  We have a friendly relationship with Germany, so we can coordinate to threaten or attack Austria and possibly move into RUM or BUD in subsequent turns.

- **Next steps:**
  Focus on expanding into RUM and BUD, and threaten Turkey's holdings in ARM and SMY. For this turn, I will move units to prepare for these objectives.

**Order choices:**

- A MOS to UKR to threaten Austria and prepare for future expansion.
- F SEV to ARM to threaten Turkey and support Black Sea operations.
- A WAR to RUM to threaten Austria and open a path into the Balkans.
- Support moves to bolster positions or prepare for future attacks.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure new supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control Berlin, Kiel, and Munich. I need to push outward to gain more centers, especially in the north and east, while maintaining a strong defensive posture in the west and south.

- **Kiel (KIE):** I will move F KIE to DEN to threaten the Scandinavian centers and potentially secure a route into Scandinavia, which is rich in supply centers and less defended.
- **Berlin (BER):** I will support MUN to KIE to ensure Munich remains secure and to prepare for future expansion eastward.
- **Munich (MUN):** I will move A MUN to KIE, aiming to take control of KIE and push into Scandinavia, which is weakly defended.
- **Army in Berlin (BER):** I will hold (H) to avoid overextending and to keep options open for future moves.
- **Support moves:** I will support MUN to KIE to ensure the attack succeeds, and support KIE from Berlin if needed.
- **Other units:** No immediate moves into Austria or France, as relationships are hostile, and I want to focus on expansion into Scandinavia and the east.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Denmark and Scandinavia, opening new fronts for further expansion, while consolidating my core centers.

**Orders:**

- F KIE - DEN
- A MUN - KIE
- A BER H
- A BER S A MUN - KIE
- F HEL H (Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense)
- Support move: A MUN S A BER - KIE (to ensure success of the attack on KIE)

**Note:** I will keep my options open for future alliances or betrayals, but for now, I focus on expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and secure key supply centers. Currently, Turkey controls Ankara, Constantinople, and Smyrna, with nearby unclaimed centers like Bulgaria (BUL), Rumania (RUM), and the Black Sea region (SEV).

- The immediate priority is to secure Bulgaria and Rumania, which are only two moves away, to increase our supply centers and threaten Austria and Russia.
- We should also consider supporting our units to maximize territorial gains and prepare for future expansion into the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.
- Since Russia is friendly, we can coordinate to contain Austria and possibly support each other’s expansion.
- Austria is unfriendly, so we should be cautious about their moves, but we can threaten their borders to keep them on the defensive.
- Italy remains neutral, so we should avoid provoking them unless it benefits our expansion.
- Our fleet in ANK can move to CON to secure the coast and support the army in SMY to move into Bulgaria or Rumania.
- The army in CON can support SMY into Bulgaria or RUM, or move to BUL directly if possible.
- The fleet in SMY can support the army in CON or move to ARM to threaten Russia or support a move into RUM.

Given the options, I will:
- Move F ANK to CON to secure the coast and prepare for supporting moves.
- Support A SMY into Bulgaria to threaten Austria and Rumania.
- Support A CON into Bulgaria or RUM to secure those centers.
- Hold A CON to keep options open.
- Keep F SMY supporting A SMY into Bulgaria or RUM.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumania, expand our influence in the Black Sea, and prepare for future Mediterranean expansion.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

[S1901M] France maintains a defensive stance with a focus on consolidating its holdings in Brest, Paris, and Marseilles, with no new agreements or commitments made this turn. Germany is positioning in Kie, Muen, and Ber, showing readiness for potential expansion into Central Europe. Italy's units are relatively neutral, with a slight focus on Italy's southern coast. The UK remains unresponsive to diplomatic efforts, while Russia continues to be inactive in the North Sea and the east. Turkey shows no new activity. Relationships are mostly neutral, with some unfriendly notes toward Germany and the UK.

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",

**Strategic Reasoning for S1901M:**

France's primary goal is to secure early expansion in the West and Mediterranean, focusing on gaining control of key supply centers such as Belgium (BEL), Portugal (POR), and consolidating holdings in Spain and North Africa. Currently, our units are positioned defensively, but the game calls for bold moves to capitalize on opportunities.

- **Brest (BRE):** We can attempt a support move into Picardy (PIC) or directly move into the English Channel (ENG) to threaten England early. Supporting Paris from Brest seems viable to strengthen our position in France's core.
- **Marseilles (MAR):** Our army here can either hold or push into Spain (SPA) or support other French units. Moving into Spain could threaten the southern flank and threaten Portugal.
- **Paris (PAR):** Central to French operations, moving into Belgium (BEL) may be too risky without guarantees, but supporting other moves could be strategic.

Given England's hostility, I want to preemptively threaten their supply centers to weaken their position and push for expansion into the Atlantic.

**Proposed Moves:**

- F BRE to PIC: Support the move into Picardy, or threaten the English Channel.
- F BRE to ENG: Attempt to threaten or contest the English coast.
- A MAR to SPA: Push into Spain to threaten the south and support future expansion.
- A PAR to BEL: Aiming to threaten or contest Belgium, a key center.
- Support moves to bolster these moves as needed.

This plan aims to threaten England while expanding into Spain and Belgium, setting up for a strong early game push toward the 18 SC goal.

---

**Orders:**

- F BRE - PIC
- F BRE S F LON - ENG
- A MAR - SPA
- A PAR - BEL

These moves threaten England and Spain, while consolidating our core territories. The support move helps secure the move into PIC and BEL, creating opportunities for further expansion next turn.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
What an opener! Germany rockets north as the Munich panzer corps storms into Kiel under Berlin’s guns and the fleet splashes into Denmark—a blitz that screams “Northern Domination!”  Out east, the Tsar unsheathes a gleaming blade: Moscow races to Ukraine and the Sev fleet lunges into Armenia, while Turkey ties itself in knots with a three-unit traffic jam that leaves Ankara, Smyrna, and Constantinople colliding like clown cars.  England grabs the North Sea but whiffs on a promised French escort into the Channel, even as France coolly pockets Spain—trust already fraying on the Atlantic front.

- Form a strategic alliance with Germany to contain France and Russia, allowing Austria to focus on the south and east.
- Maintain a defensive posture in the north and west to avoid overextension while consolidating gains in the south.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
What an opener! Germany rockets north as the Munich panzer corps storms into Kiel under Berlin’s guns and the fleet splashes into Denmark—a blitz that screams “Northern Domination!”  Out east, the Tsar unsheathes a gleaming blade: Moscow races to Ukraine and the Sev fleet lunges into Armenia, while Turkey ties itself in knots with a three-unit traffic jam that leaves Ankara, Smyrna, and Constantinople colliding like clown cars.  England grabs the North Sea but whiffs on a promised French escort into the Channel, even as France coolly pockets Spain—trust already fraying on the Atlantic front.  Italy’s navy surges into the Ionian and Austria bunkers up, so no dots flip yet, but the table is set for a summer slaughter with Russia and Germany punching hardest and Turkey wobbling on the ropes!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in Italy's core regions (Naples, Rome, Venice) to establish a strong economic base for future expansion.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to contain Austria and Germany, while preparing to challenge Turkey and Russia for control of the eastern and Balkan regions.
- Engage diplomatically with Turkey and Russia to avoid early conflicts, while positioning forces to threaten their supply centers and open opportunities for expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand Turkey’s control over supply centers and position for future dominance. Currently, I control Ankara, Constantinople, and Smyrna, with potential to push into Bulgaria, Rumania, and the Black Sea. Russia remains friendly, which is advantageous for cooperation in the Black Sea and Balkan regions. Austria, England, France, and Germany are hostile, so I need to be cautious but also opportunistic.

In this phase, I will focus on consolidating my position in Anatolia and the Black Sea, while preparing to seize nearby uncontrolled centers like Bulgaria and Rumania. Moving F ANK to CON supports my control of the Black Sea and prepares for future expansion into Bulgaria. Supporting Smyrna to move to ARM can threaten Russian interests and open a route into Rumania or the Black Sea.

I will order:
- F ANK to move to CON, strengthening my Black Sea control and threatening Bulgaria.
- A SMY to support A CON, reinforcing my position in Anatolia and threatening the Black Sea.
- F ARM to move to BLA, aiming to secure the Black Sea and threaten Rumania.
- A CON to support A SMY, maintaining a strong front in Anatolia and the Black Sea.

This setup positions me to threaten Bulgaria and Rumania next turn, while maintaining a defensive posture against potential German or Russian threats.

*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] All powers have responded to messages, with Austria, France, Germany, and Turkey remaining unfriendly, while Italy and Russia are neutral. No formal agreements have been reached, but communication lines are open. England's focus remains on securing and expanding in Western Europe, particularly in Belgium, the Channel, and North Sea, while maintaining a strategic alliance with France. Relationships with Austria, France, Germany, and Turkey are tense, requiring careful diplomacy. Italy and Russia are neutral, presenting potential opportunities for future alliances or expansion.

[S1901M] England is moving F EDI to NTH and supporting F LON to NTH to strengthen control over the North Sea and North Atlantic. F LON is also moving to YOR to secure the western flank. A LVP is holding, maintaining a flexible position in the south. The overall strategy focuses on consolidating control of the North Sea and North Atlantic, preparing for expansion in Western Europe, and maintaining a cautious stance towards neighbors.

[F1901M] No messages involving England this turn, indicating a period of strategic assessment or possible diplomatic silence. Relationships remain consistent with prior assessments, with ongoing tensions with Germany, France, Russia, and Turkey, and neutrality with Italy. No new agreements or commitments have been made this phase.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

England's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control three centers: EDI, LON, and LVP. Our immediate focus should be on consolidating control of the North Sea and English Channel, while also positioning for expansion into nearby unclaimed centers.

Our fleet in NTH is well-positioned to threaten or take control of Belgium (BEL), which is only one move away and a key target for expansion. Moving F NTH to ENG would threaten the English Channel and potentially cut off France's access to the North Atlantic, while supporting moves to Belgium or Holland could be beneficial.

Our fleet in YOR is already supporting the North Sea and can assist in moving into the North Atlantic or support the fleet in NTH to push into Belgium or Holland. The army in LVP is holding, but we should consider moving it to YOR or supporting it to prepare for future expansion.

Given the current map and the unfriendly relationships with France, Germany, Austria, and Turkey, we should aim to secure the North Sea and English Channel, then push into Belgium and Holland to expand our control.

Orders should be aggressive but cautious, supporting our fleets to threaten or take key centers, and positioning armies to support future moves.

**Orders:**

- F NTH - ENG (to threaten or take control of the English Channel, and support future expansion)
- F YOR - NTH (support NTH to move into Belgium or threaten the North Sea)
- A LVP - YOR (prepare to support future expansion into Holland or Belgium)
- Support F YOR - NTH with F NTH - ENG (if needed, to secure the North Sea)
- Hold or support as needed to maintain flexibility

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.

[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, focusing on consolidating the Balkans and Italy. No new agreements reached with other powers; England, France, Russia, and Turkey remain unresponsive or hostile. Italy remains neutral, providing potential for expansion in the south. No significant shifts in relationships; silent powers may be assessing their options.

[S1901M] I ordered A VIE to support GAL to secure the Austrian position in the Balkans, while holding in TRI and BUD to maintain a defensive stance. The strategic intent is to stabilize the south and east, strengthen alliances with Germany, and prepare for future expansion.

[F1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, reinforcing the alliance to contain France and Russia. No new agreements with other powers; Italy remains neutral, and Turkey and Russia are unresponsive or hostile. No messages from England or France this turn, indicating possible strategic silence or disengagement.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand and secure key centers in the Balkans and Italy, while maintaining a strong alliance with Germany to contain France and Russia. Given the current map and relationships, I will focus on consolidating my position in the south and east, while preparing for future expansion.

- I will support my units in Vienna and Budapest to strengthen my hold in the Balkans and prepare for potential moves into Rumania or Ukraine.
- I will move Austria from Budapest to Ukraine to threaten Russian holdings and potentially cut off Russian expansion into the Balkans.
- I will support Trieste to hold against Italian or other threats, but also consider moving it to Trieste if an opportunity arises.
- I will hold Vienna and Trieste for now, consolidating my position.
- I will keep my fleet in Trieste supported to maintain control of the coast and prepare for future moves into Greece or the Ionian Sea.
- I will also prepare to support my units in Vienna and Budapest to expand further or defend as needed.

This approach aims to threaten Russia and Italy, while maintaining a defensive posture in the north and west, and keeping options open for future aggressive moves.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A UKR - RUM (supporting Ukraine move to Rumania, threatening Russian expansion)
- A VIE - UKR (advance into Ukraine to threaten Russian holdings and expand influence)
- A TRI - TRI (hold to maintain control of the coast and support future moves)
- A VIE S A BUD - RUM (support Budapest to Rumania, reinforcing the south)

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively into Scandinavia and the Black Sea, while consolidating control over Ukraine and preparing to threaten Turkey’s holdings. I want to seize the key centers of ANK and BUL, and push into the Black Sea to threaten Turkey’s coast.

Currently, I have units in ARM, UKR, WAR, and STP/SC. I see an opportunity to move into SEV from UKR, which is a strategic position to threaten Turkey’s Black Sea coast and potentially support future advances into Bulgaria or the Black Sea.

I will also support the move from ARM to SEV to reinforce the Black Sea front, and I will move UKR to RUM to threaten the Romanian center, which is a key expansion target.

The fleet in STP/SC can hold or support the move into BLA if needed, but I prefer to focus on the Black Sea and Ukraine for now.

I will hold WAR to maintain a strong position in the east, and I will support the move from UKR to RUM to threaten Romania, which is a weak point for Turkey and Austria.

This aggressive stance aims to secure the Black Sea, threaten Turkey’s centers, and prepare for further expansion into Bulgaria and the Balkans.

**Orders:**

- F ARM S F ANK - BLA (support move into Black Sea, threatening Turkey)
- F ARM S A UKR - SEV (support move into SEV, Black Sea)

[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, aiming to solidify the alliance and coordinate against Austria and Germany. No new messages from Austria, England, Germany, Russia, or Turkey, indicating possible disengagement or strategic silence. Italy's units are positioned defensively in Naples, Rome, and Venice, with potential for expansion in the south and east.

[S1901M] Italy orders F NAP to move to ION, and holds A ROM and A VEN. The strategic focus is on consolidating Italy's southern centers while maintaining diplomatic flexibility to expand and counter Austria, Germany, Russia, and Turkey.

[F1901M] Italy has maintained neutral communication with France and England, focusing on strengthening naval presence and preparing for potential conflicts with Austria and Germany. No new agreements have been reached, and Austria remains hostile. Turkey and Russia continue to be unfriendly, with no responses from Turkey. Italy's focus remains on asserting influence in the Mediterranean and monitoring the northern and eastern threats.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary focus this turn is to expand and secure additional supply centers to move toward our goal of controlling 18 centers. Currently, Italy controls NAP, ROM, and VEN, with potential to expand into Greece, North Africa, and the Balkans.

- The Ionian Sea (F ION) is a key strategic position. Moving to ADR (Aegean) threatens Austria and Greece, and supports expansion into Greece or the eastern Mediterranean.
- Moving F ION to TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea) can support an attack on Trieste or defend against French or Austrian naval threats.
- The armies in ROM and VEN can coordinate to push into Trieste (TRI) or defend against Austrian counterattacks.
- Supporting A VEN to TRI with A VEN S A ROM - TRI and F ION S A VEN - TRI will help us take Trieste from Austria, which is crucial for expansion into the Balkans.
- Holding A ROM in place maintains a strong position in Italy’s heartland.
- Moving F NAP to TYS prepares for future expansion or defense, and supports the fleet in Ionian.

Given Austria's hostile stance, I want to aggressively push into Trieste, while maintaining naval flexibility in the Mediterranean. I will also keep an eye on the eastern front, but for now, focus on consolidating gains in the south and east.

**Orders:**

- A VEN to TRI (attack Austria's Trieste)
- A APU support A VEN to TRI (support the attack on Trieste)
- F ION support A VEN to TRI (support the attack on Trieste from the sea)
- A ROM hold (maintain position)
- F NAP to TYS (prepare for future expansion or defense)

This plan aims to secure Trieste, expand our influence in the Balkans, and keep options open for further expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

- Position forces to threaten Austria and Italy in the south, aiming to expand into Austria's centers and secure the southern flank.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Unfriendly
- FRANCE: Unfriendly
- RUSSIA: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Unfriendly
- ITALY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Germany this turn, indicating possible strategic silence or disengagement from other powers. Relationships remain hostile with Austria, England, France, Russia, and Turkey, with no new agreements or shifts in stance. Current game state shows Germany maintaining its core centers with no immediate diplomatic breakthroughs.

[S1901M] Moved F KIE to DEN to secure the north and open expansion options; ordered A MUN to KIE to support the attack and pressure France; held A BER and ordered A BER to support A MUN moving to KIE, aiming to strengthen the German front and prepare for potential conflicts with neighbors.

[F1901M] No messages received from other powers this turn, indicating possible strategic silence or disinterest. My focus remains on securing Kiel and Denmark, and preparing for potential conflicts with France and Russia. Relationships with Austria, England, France, Russia, and Turkey are all unfriendly, requiring cautious diplomacy and strategic positioning.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary focus this turn is to secure and expand in the north, particularly by establishing control over Kiel and Denmark, which are critical for northern dominance. The fleet in Denmark (F DEN) is well-positioned to threaten or take control of Sweden (SWE) and potentially support further expansion into Scandinavia or the Baltic. The army in Berlin (A BER) is currently holding, but I will consider supporting moves to strengthen my position or threaten Russia and France.

Given the current unfriendly relationships with Russia and France, I want to prepare for potential conflicts while also positioning for expansion. Moving F DEN to SWE can threaten the Scandinavian centers, and supporting the fleet in DEN with the army in Kiel (A KIE) to move to HOL can threaten the Low Countries, which are valuable for expansion.

I will also keep options open for future moves into the Low Countries (BEL) and possibly into the Baltic (BAL) or even support a move into the North Sea (NTH) if opportunities arise.

Since I want to maximize expansion potential, I will:
- Move F DEN to SWE to threaten Scandinavia.
- Support F DEN with A KIE to move to HOL, aiming to threaten or take the Low Countries.
- Hold Berlin (A BER) for now, but keep support options open.
- No support or attack orders for now for other units, focusing on securing the north.

**Orders:**
- F DEN - SWE (to threaten Scandinavia)
- A KIE - HOL (support move to threaten Low Countries)
- A BER H (hold for now, defend against threats)
- F DEN S F NTH - SKA (support move to threaten North Sea if needed, optional but not necessary now)
- A MUN H (hold, defend Munich)

**Note:** I will keep the support move for DEN to SWE flexible, but for now, I will not support or move into other centers to avoid overextending.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW",".

**Reasoning:**

My primary goal remains aggressive expansion, especially focusing on securing new supply centers to reach the 18 needed for victory. In the spring phase, I want to consolidate my position in the west and prepare for future pushes into central Europe.

- I will move F BRE to PIC to threaten the English Channel and potentially cut off English expansion in the north. This move also puts pressure on England's fleet in NTH, forcing them to respond.
- I will support the move from A PAR to PIC to reinforce the attack on the English Channel, aiming to dislodge England and control the western coast.
- I will also move A SPA to GAS to threaten the Gibraltar Strait, aiming to control access to the Atlantic and open options for expansion into Spain or the Atlantic.
- I will hold A MAR, as it is a strong position for future expansion into the Iberian Peninsula or southern France.

These moves are aggressive and support my overall goal of expansion, while also putting pressure on England to distract them from other fronts and potentially weaken their hold on the North Atlantic.

**Orders:**

**Note:** Since support moves are not specified in the provided options and support is only valid if explicitly supported, I am issuing straightforward moves without supports. The moves aim to maximize pressure on England and position for expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
What a turn! Germany explodes out of the gate, snatching neutral Holland to become the early table-leader on five centers, while England’s slick fleet carousel (Channel secured, North Sea reclaimed) sets up a coming showdown in the west. Disaster strikes France as the army that had pocketed Spain marches out to Gascony—dropping the hard-won center and grinding two French assaults on Picardy to a bloody stand-still—just as Italy and Austria clash in a vicious bounce over Trieste. And in the east the powder keg is primed: Warsaw’s troops storm into Galicia, Turkish armies lock each other in a paranoid embrace at Constantinople, and Austria’s bid for Rumania is cut to ribbons, promising fireworks when Winter builds hit the board!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Strengthen Italian naval presence in the Ionian to threaten Austria and secure Mediterranean influence.
- Seek diplomatic engagement with France to establish a mutual understanding or alliance against Germany and Austria.
- Prepare to contest German dominance in the north by building fleet and army units in Italy.
- Exploit Turkey's disorganized position to threaten their eastern and Balkan territories.
- Monitor Russian movements and consider alliances or coordinated actions to contain their eastern expansion.
