intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England

    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Black Sea region, leveraging our friendly relations with Russia to coordinate expansion and secure key supply centers. Our immediate focus should be on securing Bulgaria (BUL) and Rumelia (RUM), which are close and accessible, and also on threatening or taking control of the Black Sea area (Sevastopol, SEV) to threaten Russia and gain access to additional centers.

Currently, our units are positioned as follows:
- F ANK (Ankara)
- A CON (Constantinople)
- A SMY (Smyrna)

Our options:
- Use F ANK to support or move into the Black Sea (SEV) or Bulgaria (BUL).
- Use A CON to support or move into Bulgaria (BUL) or Rumelia (RUM).
- Use A SMY to support or move into Bulgaria or Rumelia, or threaten Greece.

Given the positions, I will:
- Move F ANK to support a move into SEV, aiming to threaten or take control of the Black Sea.
- Support A CON moving into BUL to secure that center.
- Use A SMY to support A CON into RUM, or move to threaten Greece (GRC) if needed.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia early, while also threatening Russia's Black Sea holdings, which can be leveraged for future expansion.

**Order choices:**
- F ANK S F SEV - ARM (supporting SEV to be taken or threatened)
- A CON - BUL (aiming to take Bulgaria)
- A SMY S A CON - RUM (supporting Rumelia, or threatening Greece)

This plan supports rapid expansion in the Balkans and Black Sea, aligning with our strategic goal of controlling more centers and exploiting our friendly relations with Russia.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively into key centers, especially in the Balkans and Italy, while maintaining a strong defensive position in Central Europe. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with units positioned to threaten Italy and Turkey.

- The immediate priority is to secure RUM and SER, which are the closest uncontrolled centers and vital for further expansion into the Balkans.
- Moving A BUD S A VIE - TRI is a good move to threaten Italy's VEN and potentially cut off Italian expansion.
- Supporting A VIE S A BUD - GAL can help secure VIE and threaten the south, possibly forcing Italy to divert units.
- Moving A VIE to GAL or BUD can threaten Italy's centers and open up options for future expansion.
- The fleet in TRI should either hold or support a move to VEN to threaten Italy further.
- Supporting A WAR S A BUD - GAL can help secure the eastern flank against Russia.
- The fleet in TRI can also convoy A VEN to TRI if needed, but for now, a support move to VEN is more flexible.

The overall plan is to pressure Italy into defensive moves, secure RUM and SER, and prepare for a push into Italy and the Balkans in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A VIE - TRI (supporting VIE to threaten Italy)
- A VIE - GAL (threatening Italy's centers and supporting future expansion)
- A WAR S A BUD - GAL (supporting the eastern flank against Russia)
- F TRI - VEN (aiming to threaten Italy's VEN and support TRI)
- A ROM H (hold to defend Italy's position)

This setup maximizes pressure on Italy, secures key Balkan centers, and positions Austria for further expansion.

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control four centers: MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. To achieve world domination, we need to seize nearby uncontrolled centers, especially RUM, ANK, and BUD, which are within reach and critical for expansion.

- **Moscow (MOS):** I will move A MOS to Ukraine (UKR) to threaten and potentially take control of it, as well as to prepare for future expansion into RUM.
- **Sevastopol (SEV):** I will support the move F SEV to RUM, aiming to take RUM next turn.
- **Warsaw (WAR):** I will support A WAR to LVN, aiming to secure the Baltic region and open a path into the west if needed.
- **Unit positioning:** Holding A WAR and F SEV in place for now, supporting aggressive moves into RUM and Ukraine.

This plan aims to secure RUM next turn, expand into Ukraine, and threaten Austria and Turkey, while maintaining a strong eastern front. Germany remains friendly, so I will keep my options open for future cooperation or betrayal.

**Orders:**

- A MOS - UKR (to threaten Ukraine and prepare for expansion)
- F SEV S F ANK - ARM (supporting the move into RUM)
- A WAR S A LVN - PRU (supporting the move into the Baltic, securing the east)
- A WAR - LVN (to strengthen the eastern front and prepare for future expansion)

**Note:** No support or hold orders are necessary for now; focus is on aggressive expansion.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's current position is stable but needs to be aggressive to expand and secure more supply centers. Our immediate focus should be on consolidating control over Venice, Rome, and Naples, while positioning to threaten Austria and France, our main rivals.

- Our fleet in Naples (F NAP) is well-placed to support an attack on Tunis or move into the Ionian Sea to threaten Austria's Trieste. Moving NAP to TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea) prepares for future expansion and defense.
- Our armies in Rome (A ROM) and Venice (A VEN) are poised to either hold or support attacks. Given Austria's unfriendly stance and the proximity of their units, we should prepare to threaten Trieste and Buda.
- Since Austria's F TRI is nearby, and Austria is unfriendly, we should consider moving our Venice army to Trieste to threaten Austria's supply centers.
- Our goal is to expand into Austria's territory and push into the Balkans, while maintaining a defensive posture against France and Turkey.

Orders:
- Venice (A VEN) will move to Trieste (A TRI) to threaten Austria's key supply center.
- Army in Rome (A ROM) will hold to defend against potential French or Austrian moves.
- Fleet in Naples (F NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to support future operations and defend against French or Tunisian threats.
- Support moves are not necessary this turn; focus on positioning for expansion.

**Orders:**
- A VEN - TRI
- A ROM - NAP (to reposition for future expansion or defend)
- F NAP - TYS

This setup positions us to threaten Austria's Trieste and Buda, while maintaining flexibility for future moves.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control London, Edinburgh, and Liverpool, totaling 3 centers. We need to seize nearby centers to accelerate our expansion.

- The immediate targets are Belgium (BEL), Holland (HOL), and Denmark (DEN), which are all within reach and critical for establishing dominance in the North Sea and English Channel.
- France is friendly, so we can coordinate with them to contain Germany and possibly support our expansion into the Low Countries.
- Germany is hostile, so we should preemptively threaten or attack their borders to weaken their position.
- Our fleet in Edinburgh (F EDI) can move to North Sea (NTH) or support moves into Belgium or Holland.
- Our fleet in London (F LON) can support or move into the North Sea or English Channel.
- Our army in Liverpool (A LVP) can move to support or threaten Belgium or Holland.

Given the options, I will:
- Use F EDI to move into the North Sea (NTH) to threaten Germany and support future attacks.
- Use F LON to move into the North Sea as well, reinforcing our control of the vital waterway.
- Use A LVP to support an attack into Belgium or Holland, or move to support our fleet's advance.
- Focus on securing Belgium and Holland in the next turn, while maintaining flexibility.

This aggressive stance will help us expand quickly, threaten Germany, and position ourselves for further expansion into Scandinavia and the Low Countries.

- F EDI - NTH
- F LON - NTH
- A LVP S F EDI - NTH
- Support moves to threaten or attack Belgium and Holland in subsequent turns.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",

    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Germany controls Berlin, Kiel, and Munich. Our immediate focus should be on expanding into neighboring neutral centers, especially the Low Countries (Belgium and Holland), which are close and relatively easy to take early on.

- Kie is well-positioned to move into Holland (HOL) or Denmark (DEN). Securing HOL will give us a crucial supply center and open up options for future expansion into the North Sea and Scandinavia.
- Munich can support an attack into Belgium (BEL), which is a key target for expansion.
- Berlin can also support moves into Kiel or further into the Low Countries.

Given the current map, the best move is to use the fleet in Kie to move into Holland, as it is a quick and safe expansion. The army in Munich can move into Belgium, supported by the fleet in Kiel, which can also support the move into Holland if needed.

Since Austria is unfriendly and Russia is neutral, I will avoid overextending eastward for now and focus on consolidating the West. The fleet in Kie should move to HOL to secure it, and the army in MUN should move to BEL to threaten or take it.

Support moves will be used to ensure successful captures, and I will hold Berlin for now, as it is a strong defensive position.

**Order plan:**
- F KIE -> HOL (to secure Holland)
- A MUN -> BEL (to threaten or take Belgium)
- F HEL H (hold Heligoland Bight for naval control)
- A BER H (hold Berlin for defense)
- Support moves as needed to support the attack on Belgium and Holland.

This aggressive expansion will help us gain two vital centers early, setting us on the path toward 18.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates as Austria knifes into Galicia, Russia counters with twin lunges to Ukraine and Livonia, and Turkey swaggers into Bulgaria—suddenly the East is a powder keg. In the boot, Italy’s navy rockets into the Tyrrhenian while a Venice-Trieste slugfest ends in a bloody bounce, signalling instant Italo-Austrian bad blood. Up north, England’s twin thrusts toward the North Sea slam into a German wall, yet Kaiser Wilhelm quietly pockets Holland as France holds its elegant line. The much-touted Russo-Turkish “Black Sea handshake” fizzles, leaving every alliance in question—no centers change hands yet, but the battle lines are drawn and the crowd is primed for an explosive autumn!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates as Austria knifes into Galicia, Russia counters with twin lunges to Ukraine and Livonia, and Turkey swaggers into Bulgaria—suddenly the East is a powder keg. In the boot, Italy’s navy rockets into the Tyrrhenian while a Venice-Trieste slugfest ends in a bloody bounce, signalling instant Italo-Austrian bad blood. Up north, England’s twin thrusts toward the North Sea slam into a German wall, yet Kaiser Wilhelm quietly pockets Holland as France holds its elegant line. The much-touted Russo-Turkish “Black Sea handshake” fizzles, leaving every alliance in question—no centers change hands yet, but the battle lines are drawn and the crowd is primed for an explosive autumn!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand within Central Europe and the Balkans by establishing control over key supply centers such as TRI, VIE, and BUD, while preparing to challenge Turkey and Italy for their nearby centers.
- Form a strategic alliance with Germany to contain Russia and France, while cautiously approaching Italy and Turkey for potential cooperation or neutralization.
- Avoid early conflicts with England and France, focusing instead on consolidating Austria's position and preparing for a coordinated push into the eastern and southern territories.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates as Austria knifes into Galicia, Russia counters with twin lunges to Ukraine and Livonia, and Turkey swaggers into Bulgaria—suddenly the East is a powder keg. In the boot, Italy’s navy rockets into the Tyrrhenian while a Venice-Trieste slugfest ends in a bloody bounce, signalling instant Italo-Austrian bad blood. Up north, England’s twin thrusts toward the North Sea slam into a German wall, yet Kaiser Wilhelm quietly pockets Holland as France holds its elegant line. The much-touted Russo-Turkish “Black Sea handshake” fizzles, leaving every alliance in question—no centers change hands yet, but the battle lines are drawn and the crowd is primed for an explosive autumn!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in the North Sea and English Channel to establish dominance over the North Atlantic and secure vital supply centers.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to contain Germany and Italy, while preparing for a potential push into Scandinavia and the Low Countries.
- Maintain a flexible stance with Russia and Turkey, avoiding early conflicts while monitoring their movements for future opportunities or threats.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

  Russia
    - Moscow
    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with France, confirming their cooperation in the North Sea and English Channel. No responses from Russia, Italy, or Turkey, indicating possible disinterest or strategic silence. Germany remains hostile, and Austria is unfriendly, with ongoing tensions. No new agreements reached this turn.

[S1901M] Moved F EDI and F LON to NTH to secure control of the North Sea and English Channel, aiming for dominance in the North Atlantic. Held A LVP to maintain flexibility and avoid early conflict. Strategic focus on securing northern waters and preparing for expansion while maintaining alliances.

[F1901M] Maintained friendly relations with France, confirming their support in the North Sea and English Channel. Germany remains hostile, with no response to recent messages, indicating potential opposition. Austria is unfriendly, focusing on eastern expansion, while Italy and Russia are neutral, observing the situation. Turkey is unfriendly, likely watching for opportunities against my fleet movements.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control 3 centers (EDI, LON, LVP). We need to seize nearby unclaimed centers and threaten Germany and France to prevent them from consolidating power.

- The North Sea and English Channel are critical for expansion and defense. Maintaining control here is essential.
- Moving F EDI to NTH will threaten Germany’s HOL and potentially cut off their access to the North Atlantic.
- Moving F LON to NTH supports the same goal, reinforcing our northern flank and preparing for future expansion into Belgium and Denmark.
- Supporting F EDI with F LON (via F LON S F EDI - NTH) strengthens our position in the North Sea.
- Moving F EDI to YOR is a bold move to threaten Yorkshire, potentially forcing a German response or gaining a foothold in the north.
- Moving F LON to YOR is also aggressive, aiming to threaten or support a move into Yorkshire or support the attack on the North Sea.

This approach aims to secure the North Sea and English Channel, threaten Germany’s northern centers, and position ourselves for further expansion into Belgium, Denmark, or Scandinavia in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- F EDI - NTH
- F LON - NTH
- F LON S F EDI - NTH
- F EDI - YOR
- F LON - YOR

These moves are aggressive, support expansion, and threaten key German centers, aligning with our goal of rapid expansion and dominance.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and secure additional supply centers. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with potential to push into Ukraine, Rumania, and the Balkans. Russia is hostile, and Turkey is actively opposing us, so we need to be cautious but also opportunistic.

In this phase, I will focus on consolidating our eastern front and preparing for expansion into Ukraine and Rumania, which are key to reaching 18 centers. Moving A BUD to GAL supports our eastern expansion and threatens Russian units in Ukraine. Supporting A GAL from BUD will help us secure Galicia, which is vital for future operations.

Moving A GAL to UKR is a bold move to threaten Ukraine directly, forcing Russia to respond or lose a critical center. Supporting A UKR from GAL will help ensure its success if Russia attempts to defend.

Supporting F TRI from VIE maintains control of Trieste and keeps our southern flank stable, while moving F TRI to VEN prepares for potential expansion into Italy or to threaten Italian units.

This setup positions us to threaten Ukraine and Rumania next turn, while maintaining control of our core centers and supporting our strategic goals.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively while consolidating our core positions. Currently, Germany controls Berlin, Kiel, and Munich, which are solid foundations. The map shows potential for expansion into the Low Countries (Belgium and Holland) and possibly into France or Scandinavia.

- Moving the Army in Berlin (A BER) to Prussia (PRU) is a strategic move to threaten Russia's Baltic holdings and prepare for future expansion eastward.
- Moving the Army in Munich (A MUN) to Silesia (SIL) supports a push into Poland and potentially into Galicia, which is contested with Austria.
- The Fleet in Kiel (F KIE) should move into Holland (HOL) to secure the Low Countries, which are critical for western expansion and to threaten France from the north.
- The Fleet in Holland (F HOL) should support the Kiel move into Holland or prepare to support a move into Belgium if the opportunity arises.
- Holding in Munich (A MUN) and Berlin (A BER) for now, but with an eye on future aggressive moves.

This setup aims to secure the Low Countries early, threaten Russia in the east, and position for expansion into France or Scandinavia. The relationships are tense, but we need to act decisively to achieve world domination.

**Orders:**

- A BER S A MUN - SIL (support move from Munich to Silesia, threatening Poland and supporting expansion east)
- A MUN - SIL (advance into Silesia to threaten Poland and prepare for further eastward expansion)
- F KIE - HOL (secure the Low Countries, threaten France from the north)
- F HOL - BEL (support the move into Belgium or prepare to support KIE into HOL)
- Hold in Munich (A MUN H) and Berlin (A BER H) for now, maintaining flexibility

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is ITALY. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: ITALY
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Strengthen defenses in Naples, Rome, and Venice to withstand Austrian and Russian pressure.
- Open diplomatic channels with France to secure a non-aggression agreement and explore alliance opportunities.
- Monitor Austria's moves in Galicia and prepare to contest Trieste and Venice if Austria advances further.
- Engage Turkey diplomatically to prevent Balkan conflicts and consider coordinated moves against Austria or Russia.
- Position navy in the Tyrrhenian to threaten Austria and prepare for expansion into the central Mediterranean.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Enemy
- FRANCE: Friendly
- GERMANY: Neutral
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Enemy
- TURKEY: Enemy

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, aiming to solidify an alliance to contain Austria and Germany. No recent messages from Austria, Germany, or Turkey, indicating possible hesitation or strategic silence. Austria remains unfriendly, and Russia is unfriendly, with no recent engagement. Italy's units are positioned defensively in Naples, Rome, and Venice, with potential for expansion in the south and east.

[S1901M] I am moving A VEN to TRI to secure Trieste, A ROM to NAP to strengthen Italy's southern position, and F NAP to TYS to support naval control in the Mediterranean, aiming to consolidate Italy's core regions and prepare for future expansion.

[F1901M] Italy has established a friendly relationship with France, opening channels for potential non-aggression and alliance. Relations with Austria and Russia are hostile, with Austria viewed as an enemy and Russia as an adversary. Germany and England remain neutral, with no recent communication. Turkey is considered an enemy, and no messages have been received from them this round. Italy's focus remains on defending key centers and expanding into the central Mediterranean, while monitoring Austria's movements and maintaining diplomatic flexibility.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's primary goal is to expand aggressively into the central Mediterranean and contest Austria's holdings, especially Trieste and Buda. Currently, Italy controls Naples, Rome, and Venice, with units positioned defensively. France remains friendly, providing an opportunity to focus on Austria and the eastern front.

In this turn, I will:

- Use the army in Venice to attack Trieste, supported by the army in Apulia, aiming to take Trieste from Austria.
- Use the fleet in Tyrrhenian to support the attack on Trieste from the sea, increasing the chances of success.
- Keep the army in Rome on hold to defend against potential Austrian or French moves.
- Move the fleet in Naples to Tyrrhenian Sea to threaten Austria and prepare for future expansion into the central Mediterranean.
- Maintain a flexible stance with the army in Naples, considering support or repositioning next turn based on Austria's response.

This aggressive stance aims to weaken Austria early, seize key supply centers, and set the stage for further expansion into the Balkans and the Mediterranean.

**Orders:**

- A VEN - TRI (attack Austria's Trieste with support from A APU)
- A APU S A VEN - TRI (support the attack on Trieste)
- F TYS S A VEN - TRI (support the attack on Trieste from the sea)
- A ROM H (hold to defend Italy's core)
- F NAP - TYS (move fleet to Tyrrhenian to threaten Austria and prepare for future expansion)

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, securing their support for eastern expansion. No responses from Austria, England, Italy, or Turkey, indicating either strategic silence or disinterest. Relations with France and Turkey remain hostile, with ongoing threats in the east and south. No new agreements reached this turn.

[S1901M] Russia orders Army MOS to Ukraine, Fleet SEV to support Fleet ANK moving to ARM, Army WAR to Livonia, and Fleet STP/SC to hold. The strategy aims to secure eastern centers, threaten Turkey in the Black Sea, and maintain a flexible front to expand or respond to Western threats.

[F1901M] Russia maintains a defensive stance with Ukraine and Livonia, focusing on securing Moscow and St. Petersburg. No new agreements have been reached this turn. Germany remains a friendly partner, while Austria and England are unfriendly, and Turkey is an enemy. No direct negotiations with Turkey or Austria this round, but tensions persist. The game state shows Russia with a solid eastern position but needs to be cautious of Austrian and Turkish threats.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls 4 centers (MOS, SEV, STP, WAR). To achieve world domination, I need to seize nearby unclaimed centers and threaten my enemies, especially Austria and Turkey, who are unfriendly and pose threats to my eastern and southern borders.

In this phase, I will:

- Support my fleet in SEV to move into the Black Sea (ARM), threatening Turkey and gaining access to the Mediterranean.
- Use my army in UKR to move into MOS, consolidating my control over the eastern front and preparing for future expansion westward.
- Use my army in LVN to support UKR into WAR, or alternatively, move to WAR to threaten Austria and prepare for a push into BUD or BLA later.
- Keep my units flexible, with the possibility to support or hold depending on enemy moves.

This aggressive stance aims to threaten Turkey in the Black Sea, threaten Austria in BUD and GAL, and position myself for future expansion into Central Europe and the Balkans.

**Orders:**

- F SEV - ARM (to threaten Turkey and gain Black Sea access)
- A UKR - MOS (to secure Moscow and prepare for expansion westward)
- A LVN - WAR (to threaten Austria and support UKR)
- A UKR S A LVN - WAR (support move for UKR into WAR)
- A WAR H (hold for now, maintaining flexibility)

This plan emphasizes aggressive expansion, strategic threats, and positioning for future gains.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Turkey controls Ankar, Smyrna, and Bulgaria. Our immediate focus should be on consolidating control of Bulgaria and Rumelia, while also positioning to threaten Austria and Russia, especially in Galicia and the Balkans.

Given the current map, I see an opportunity to push into Bulgaria from Smyrna and Bulgaria, and to threaten Austria's Galicia. Moving A BUL to RUM will help us secure Rumelia, and supporting A BUL from Smyrna will strengthen our hold on Bulgaria.

In Anatolia, supporting F ANK to SEV will help us maintain Black Sea dominance, which is crucial for future expansion and pressure on Russia and Austria. Moving F ANK to support F SEV to ARM is a bold move to threaten the Black Sea and potentially cut off Russian access.

The fleet in Smyrna can support A BUL to RUM, and the army in Smyrna can also support A SMY to CON to threaten Greece and further destabilize Austria's Balkan position.

I will hold Smyrna to maintain flexibility and avoid overextension, but I will prepare to support or attack as opportunities arise.

**Key moves:**
- Support A BUL to RUM from Smyrna.
- Support F SEV to ARM to threaten the Black Sea.
- Move F ANK to support F SEV to ARM.
- Support A SMY to CON to threaten Greece and Austria.
- Hold units to maintain flexibility.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia, threaten Austria's Galicia, and prepare for further expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom! Germany rockets into the lead by snatching unopposed Belgium, while a sleepy France just holds the line. In the east the Juggernaut engine roars to life—Turkey’s Ankara guns escort Russia’s Sevastopol fleet into Armenia, a flashy show of trust that chills every Austrian bone. Austria and Italy clash in a bruising Ven-Tri standoff, and over in Britain the Royal Navy face-plants as both home fleets collide and bounce in Yorkshire. The momentum meter swings hard toward Berlin and the Russo-Turkish duo, setting the stage for a brutal 1902!

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom! Germany rockets into the lead by snatching unopposed Belgium, while a sleepy France just holds the line. In the east the Juggernaut engine roars to life—Turkey’s Ankara guns escort Russia’s Sevastopol fleet into Armenia, a flashy show of trust that chills every Austrian bone. Austria and Italy clash in a bruising Ven-Tri standoff, and over in Britain the Royal Navy face-plants as both home fleets collide and bounce in Yorkshire. The momentum meter swings hard toward Berlin and the Russo-Turkish duo, setting the stage for a brutal 1902!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and defend Bulgaria and Rumelia to consolidate Balkan control.
- Strengthen alliance with Russia to counter Austria and Germany, possibly coordinating Black Sea and eastern moves.
- Prepare for a potential counterattack against Austria in Galicia and the Balkans.
- Maintain flexibility to respond to Italian naval threats and avoid overextension.
- Exploit the Black Sea situation to gain additional centers or pressure Austria and Russia.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom! Germany rockets into the lead by snatching unopposed Belgium, while a sleepy France just holds the line. In the east the Juggernaut engine roars to life—Turkey’s Ankara guns escort Russia’s Sevastopol fleet into Armenia, a flashy show of trust that chills every Austrian bone. Austria and Italy clash in a bruising Ven-Tri standoff, and over in Britain the Royal Navy face-plants as both home fleets collide and bounce in Yorkshire. The momentum meter swings hard toward Berlin and the Russo-Turkish duo, setting the stage for a brutal 1902!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Strengthen defenses in Naples, Rome, and Venice to withstand Austrian and Russian pressure.
- Open diplomatic channels with France to secure a non-aggression agreement and explore alliance opportunities.
- Monitor Austria's moves in Galicia and prepare to contest Trieste and Venice if Austria advances further.
- Engage Turkey diplomatically to prevent Balkan conflicts and consider coordinated moves against Austria or Russia.
- Position navy in the Tyrrhenian to threaten Austria and prepare for expansion into the central Mediterranean.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):

[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, focusing on potential cooperation in the Black Sea and Balkans. No new agreements with Austria, Italy, France, or Germany; their hostility remains evident. England remains neutral but unresponsive, and no direct negotiations have been initiated with them this turn.

[S1901M] Ordered F SEV to support ARM to strengthen Black Sea position, moved A CON to BUL to secure the Balkans, and ordered A SMY to hold, aiming to consolidate control in Anatolia and prepare for expansion.

[F1901M] (LLM diary entry generation or parsing failed.)

[F1901M] I ordered A SMY to CON as a defensive move, with support from F ANK from SEV to ARM to strengthen Black Sea control. A SMY is held for potential flexibility. A BUL is held to maintain Balkan presence. These orders aim to defend key positions, support alliance with Russia, and prepare for future expansion or counterattacks.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively while maintaining a strong position in the Black Sea and Balkans. Currently, Turkey has four supply centers, and we need to push for more to reach the 18 needed for victory.

- The Black Sea is a critical area. We have F ANK, which is well-positioned to threaten or support moves into the Black Sea, especially against Austria and Russia.
- Our army in Smyrna (A SMY) is holding, but I want to prepare for expansion into Greece or further into the Balkans.
- Bulgaria (BUL) is held, but I should consider supporting or attacking to secure it or push into Greece.
- Our fleet in ANK is supporting the Black Sea, and I want to leverage this to pressure Austria and Russia.
- Since Russia is friendly, I will avoid direct conflict there for now but remain prepared to exploit any weakness.
- Austria is an enemy, so I should consider moves to threaten their centers, especially Trieste or Vienna.
- The current orders should focus on consolidating control in the Black Sea, supporting Bulgaria, and preparing for expansion into Greece or the Aegean.

I will order:
- F ANK to support A SMY to BUL, strengthening our Balkan position.
- A SMY to move into Greece (GRC) to threaten Austria's flank.
- F ANK to hold, maintaining flexibility.
- A BUL to hold, consolidating our Balkan front.

This setup allows us to threaten Austria's supply centers and prepare for further expansion, while maintaining a defensive stance against potential Austrian or German threats.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Germany controls Berlin, Kiel, Munich, and Belgium. To achieve world domination, we need to take advantage of the current diplomatic landscape:

- Russia is an ally, which can help pressure Austria and potentially open eastern opportunities.
- Austria is an enemy, so we should consider attacking or pressuring their centers, especially Galicia.
- France is unfriendly, and we should prepare to threaten or attack their centers, especially in the west.
- England and Italy are neutral or unresponsive, so we can focus on our main targets without immediate concern for their interference.
- Our fleet in Kiel can support an attack into Denmark or Holland, while armies in Berlin and Munich can push into Austria or France.

Given the current orders, I will:

- Support a move from Kiel to Denmark to secure the north and threaten Scandinavia.
- Use Munich to support an attack into Austria's Galicia, aiming to weaken Austria's eastern position.
- Move Berlin to Silesia to threaten Austria further and prepare for a potential attack on Vienna or Galicia.
- Prepare to attack France or the Low Countries in subsequent turns, but for now, focus on consolidating eastern gains and threatening Austria.

This approach leverages our alliance with Russia, pressures Austria, and sets up future expansion into France and the Low Countries.

**Orders:**

- Support F KIE - DEN to secure the north and threaten Scandinavia.
- A MUN - GAL to attack Austria's Galicia.
- A BER - SIL to threaten Austria further and prepare for eastern expansion.
- F BEL - ENG to threaten England's coast and keep their fleet occupied.
- Hold Munich and Berlin to maintain flexibility and defend against potential counterattacks.

**Final Orders:**

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter 1901 ends with a thunderclap: Germany’s daring grab of Belgium, Russia’s lightning push all the way to Armenia, and Turkey’s swoop into Bulgaria rocket the trio into a four-center tie for first. Austria, France, England, and Italy each clutch a modest three, their uneasy peace crackling with tension as fleets bristle in the Channel, the Tyrrhenian, and the Adriatic. No builds hit the water this phase, but the empty slips in Berlin, Sevastopol, and Constantinople are ticking time bombs poised to explode in Spring. Strap in—alliances are fragile, knives are sharpened, and the sprint for 18 is about to get savage!

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter 1901 ends with a thunderclap: Germany’s daring grab of Belgium, Russia’s lightning push all the way to Armenia, and Turkey’s swoop into Bulgaria rocket the trio into a four-center tie for first. Austria, France, England, and Italy each clutch a modest three, their uneasy peace crackling with tension as fleets bristle in the Channel, the Tyrrhenian, and the Adriatic.

- Maintain alliance with Turkey to counterbalance German expansion in the west.
- Prepare for a potential German push into Scandinavia or Eastern Europe by strengthening eastern borders.
- Seek diplomatic opportunities to isolate Germany or forge new alliances to counterbalance their dominance.

  ]
}

4. As England, after a failed attack on Belgium (BEL) which was occupied by France, supported by Germany. Russia moved into Sweden (SWE) uncontested. Austria and Italy skirmished over Trieste (TRI). Turkey was quiet.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""My attack on Belgium was decisively repulsed due to Franco-German cooperation, marking them as a significant threat bloc. Russia's acquisition of Sweden is concerning for my northern position. The Austro-Italian conflict seems localized for now, and Turkey's inactivity makes them an unknown variable, potentially open to diplomacy."",
  ""relationships"": {
    ""FRANCE"": ""Enemy"",
    ""GERMANY"": ""Enemy"",
    ""RUSSIA"": ""Unfriendly"",
    ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",
    ""ITALY"": ""Neutral"",
    ""TURKEY"": ""Neutral""
  },
  ""goals"": [
    ""Break the Franco-German alliance or find a way to counter their combined strength."",
    ""Secure North Sea (NTH) and prevent further Russian expansion towards Norway (NWY)."",
    ""Seek dialogue with Turkey or Austria/Italy to create a counterweight to the dominant bloc.""
  ]
}

5. As Russia, after successfully negotiating passage through Black Sea (BLA) with Turkey to take Rumania (RUM). Germany moved into Silesia (SIL), threatening Warsaw (WAR). Austria and France exchanged hostile messages but made no direct moves against each other. England built a new fleet in London (LON). Italy seems focused west.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""Securing Rumania via Turkish agreement is a major success. This improves my southern position and Turkey is now a provisional ally. Germany's move into Silesia is a direct and immediate threat to Warsaw; they are now my primary adversary. Austria and France are posturing, but their conflict doesn't directly affect me yet, keeping them neutral. England's new fleet is a long-term concern but not immediate. Italy's westward focus means they are not a current threat or priority."",
  ""relationships"": {
    ""GERMANY"": ""Enemy"",
    ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",
    ""TURKEY"": ""Ally"",
    ""ITALY"": ""Neutral"",
    ""FRANCE"": ""Neutral"",
    ""ENGLAND"": ""Unfriendly""
  },
  ""goals"": [
    ""Defend Warsaw against Germany, possibly by moving Lvn-War or Mos-War."",
    ""Solidify alliance with Turkey, potentially coordinating further moves in the south or against Austria if Germany allies with them."",

  ""reasoning"": ""Germany's aggressive expansion into Belgium and Russia's rapid advance to Armenia indicate a highly volatile and competitive environment. The trio of Germany, Russia, and Turkey now holds a significant lead, creating a potential threat to England's position. France remains neutral, but the overall tension suggests the need to bolster naval defenses and seek diplomatic alliances to counterbalance the dominant powers. Austria and Italy are weaker, presenting opportunities for exploitation or alliance shifts. Relationships with Russia and Turkey are currently friendly, which can be leveraged for strategic cooperation, while Germany is clearly an enemy due to their aggressive moves. France's neutrality offers a chance to negotiate a defensive or offensive pact, and Austria and Italy are potential targets or allies depending on their actions."",
