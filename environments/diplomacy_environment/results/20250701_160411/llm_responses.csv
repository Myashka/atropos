atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

    ""Secure control of the North Sea to ensure naval dominance and protect against potential threats from France and Germany."",

}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Goals:**
  1. **Secure the North Sea:** This is crucial for England's defense and offensive capabilities. Controlling the North Sea allows for flexibility in moving fleets and projecting power into Scandinavia and the Low Countries.
  2. **Expand into Neutral Centers:** Norway and Belgium are key targets for early expansion. They are relatively accessible and can be secured with minimal conflict if diplomatic relations are managed well.
  3. **Diplomatic Strategy:** Forming a strong alliance with either France or Germany can prevent being caught in a two-front war. This allows England to focus its efforts on expansion rather than defense.

- **Initial Relationships:**
  - All relationships are marked as ""Neutral"" at the start. This reflects the need to assess the intentions of other players and form alliances or rivalries based on their actions and negotiations in the early game.",Success: Applied LLM data

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Greetings from England! As we begin our journey in this game, I propose we consider a peaceful relationship. I am interested in securing the North Sea and expanding towards Norway. I have no intentions towards the English Channel or your territories. Let's discuss how we can support each other's growth.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hi France, I wanted to reach out to discuss our positions. While I recognize our current tensions, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to avoid conflict in the early game. Perhaps we can agree to a non-aggression pact and focus on our respective expansions?

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ITALY: Hello! I am interested in maintaining peaceful relations between our nations. I plan to focus my initial expansion towards Tunis. Let's discuss how we can avoid any unnecessary conflicts in the future.

{""negotiation_summary"": ""France continues to ignore my alliance proposals regarding Belgium and the Channel, having not responded to messages in the last two phases.

  ENGLAND: Greetings Russia! As we start this game, I wanted to reach out and express my interest in maintaining a peaceful relationship. My initial focus is on securing the North Sea and expanding towards Norway. I hope we can find ways to cooperate and avoid conflict in the north.
  RUSSIA: Hello! I am interested in maintaining peace in the north. I plan to move my fleet from St. Petersburg to the Baltic Sea. This move is not intended to threaten you, but rather to secure my position. I hope we can work together to ensure stability in Scandinavia.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ITALY: Hello! I am currently focusing on the Mediterranean. I would like to propose a non-aggression pact between our nations to ensure peace on our fronts.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  RUSSIA: Greetings! As we both have a friendly understanding, I propose we coordinate our moves in the north. I plan to move my fleet from St. Petersburg to the Baltic Sea, which should not interfere with your operations. Let's ensure mutual growth and security in our regions.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  RUSSIA: Hello! I understand there might be some tension between us, but I believe we can find common ground. I am moving towards Rumania and have no immediate plans against your territories. Let's discuss how we can avoid unnecessary conflict and perhaps find areas of cooperation.
  TURKEY: Hello, my friend! I hope we can work together to secure our interests in the Balkans. I plan to move towards Bulgaria and Romania, and I would appreciate your support in this endeavor. Let's discuss how we can coordinate our efforts to counter any threats from Austria and Italy.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Greetings from England! As we begin our journey in this game, I propose we consider a peaceful relationship. I am interested in securing the North Sea and expanding towards Norway.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hi France, I wanted to reach out to discuss our positions. While I recognize our current tensions, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to avoid conflict in the early game. Perhaps we can agree to a non-aggression pact and focus on our respective expansions?

- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is seeking to establish a cooperative relationship with Austria to counter Russian influence, while also proposing a non-aggression pact with France. England has expressed a desire for cooperation in the North Sea, but Germany remains cautious due to England's unfriendly stance. Turkey is looking to expand in the Balkans, and Russia has proposed coordination in the north. France has not responded to Germany's outreach, indicating potential hostility or indifference.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

gpt-4o,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is open to cooperation in the North Sea region, suggesting a mutual non-aggression stance. Russia has indicated a move to the Baltic Sea, which they claim is non-threatening. France has not responded to my proposal for peace and cooperation, which may indicate other priorities or potential hostility. Italy is focused on the Mediterranean and not a current concern.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As England, my primary goal in the early game is to secure key positions and expand into neutral supply centers. The North Sea is crucial for naval dominance and future expansion into Scandinavia and the Low Countries. Given the current diplomatic landscape, I have a friendly relationship with Germany and a neutral stance with Russia, while France appears unfriendly. This suggests a cautious approach towards France while leveraging my relationship with Germany.

1. **Fleet in Edinburgh (F EDI):** The North Sea (NTH) is a strategic location that provides access to Norway, Denmark, and Belgium. Moving F EDI to NTH will secure this critical area and allow for future expansion into Norway.

2. **Fleet in London (F LON):** Moving F LON to the North Sea (NTH) will provide additional support and ensure control over this vital region. This move also positions the fleet for potential future operations in the English Channel or towards Belgium.

3. **Army in Liverpool (A LVP):** Moving A LVP to Yorkshire (YOR) positions the army for potential convoy operations in the future and secures the northern part of England. This move also keeps the army flexible for future actions, such as supporting operations in the North Sea or moving towards the continent.

Power: RUSSIA
Phase: S1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure early supply centers: Focus on capturing neutral supply centers such as Sweden, Rumania, and potentially Norway or Bulgaria to strengthen our position.
- Establish a strong presence in the north: Use the fleet in St. Petersburg to exert influence in the Baltic Sea and potentially move towards Scandinavia.
- Manage southern threats: Balance relations with Turkey and Austria to prevent a strong southern alliance against us, while keeping an eye on potential opportunities for expansion.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Neutral
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Neutral
- GERMANY: Neutral
- ITALY: Friendly
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria is open to a non-aggression pact in the Balkans, which aligns with our interest in securing Rumania. England is interested in peace in the north, but our move to the Baltic Sea might cause tension. Italy proposes a non-aggression pact, which could help focus on other fronts. Germany has not responded, which may indicate a lack of interest or other priorities. Turkey is focused on Bulgaria and Romania, suggesting potential conflict over these areas.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Russia in Spring 1901, my primary goal is to secure early supply centers and establish a strong position in both the north and south. Given the current diplomatic landscape and the possible orders, here's my strategic plan:

1. **Northern Strategy:**
   - **Fleet in St. Petersburg (F STP/SC):** Move to the Baltic Sea (BAL) to exert influence in Scandinavia and potentially secure Sweden in the fall. This move is also a signal to England that I am not immediately threatening Norway, aligning with our conversation about maintaining peace in the north.

2. **Southern Strategy:**
   - **Army in Moscow (A MOS):** Move to Ukraine (UKR) to position for a potential move into Rumania in the fall. This move also provides flexibility to support actions in the south or respond to any Turkish aggression.
   - **Fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV):** Move to the Black Sea (BLA) to counter Turkish influence and secure a strategic position. This move is crucial given Turkey's interest in the Balkans and potential conflict over Rumania and Bulgaria.
   - **Army in Warsaw (A WAR):** Move to Galicia (GAL) to apply pressure on Austria and potentially support future moves into Rumania or other Balkan territories. This move also serves as a defensive posture against any Austrian aggression.

These moves aim to secure key positions and supply centers while maintaining flexibility to adapt to the evolving diplomatic landscape.

gpt-4o-mini,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

gpt-4o,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Italy in Spring 1901, my primary goal is to secure Tunis, which is a key neutral supply center in the Mediterranean. This will set the stage for further expansion and strengthen my position in the region. I have established a tentative understanding with Austria to focus on different regions, which allows me to concentrate on the Mediterranean without immediate concern for the Balkans.

1. **Fleet in Naples (F NAP):** The fleet will move to the Ionian Sea (ION) to position itself for a move to Tunis in the fall. This move is crucial for securing Tunis and expanding my influence in the Mediterranean.

2. **Army in Rome (A ROM):** The army will move to Apulia (APU). This move positions the army to support future operations in the Adriatic or to reinforce the defense of Italy if needed.

3. **Army in Venice (A VEN):** The army will hold in Venice. Given the friendly relations with Austria, there is no immediate threat from the east, and holding in Venice ensures stability and readiness for future moves.

These moves align with my strategic goals of securing Tunis and maintaining stability in Italy while preparing for potential future expansions.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Lightning cracked over Europe as Germany lunged into Denmark and Russia unleashed a twin advance to Galicia and Ukraine, suddenly menacing both Vienna and Berlin at once. Austria sneakily slid into Romania while throwing a “trust-fall” support toward a German Bohemia attack that never materialized, hinting at shaky early alliances. The crowd roared when England’s own fleets smashed into each other in the North Sea, handing a static France a free pass and drawing laughs across the channel. Black-Sea fireworks saw Russia and Turkey deadlock, and with Italy quietly seizing the Ionian and Apulia, every front is now primed for a blood-soaked Fall grab for centers.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Lightning cracked over Europe as Germany lunged into Denmark and Russia unleashed a twin advance to Galicia and Ukraine, suddenly menacing both Vienna and Berlin at once. Austria sneakily slid into Romania while throwing a “trust-fall” support toward a German Bohemia attack that never materialized, hinting at shaky early alliances. The crowd roared when England’s own fleets smashed into each other in the North Sea, handing a static France a free pass and drawing laughs across the channel. Black-Sea fireworks saw Russia and Turkey deadlock, and with Italy quietly seizing the Ionian and Apulia, every front is now primed for a blood-soaked Fall grab for centers.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure Rumania and Serbia to increase supply centers and strengthen position in the Balkans.
- Establish a strong alliance with Italy to counterbalance threats from Germany and Russia.
- Maintain a defensive posture against potential aggression from Germany while seeking opportunities to expand into the German territories.

[S1901M] Established a friendly alliance with Italy to secure the Balkans, with Italy focusing on the Mediterranean. Germany expressed interest in a neutral stance but is seen as unfriendly. Russia is open to cooperation but has conflicting interests in Romania. Turkey seeks a peaceful relationship but is also eyeing the Balkans. No responses from England or France, indicating potential indifference or prioritization of other relationships.

[S1901M] Austria aims to secure Rumania with A BUD moving there, while F TRI holds defensively. A VIE supports A MUN into BOH, strengthening the position against Germany and fostering an alliance with Italy.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Turkey is focused on securing Bulgaria and Romania, with positive discussions with Russia about potential cooperation. Italy expresses a desire for peaceful coexistence, while Austria remains unresponsive. Germany is open to alliances but has not engaged directly with Turkey. Overall, relationships with Austria and Italy are unfriendly, while Russia is friendly.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria for expansion and to strengthen ties with Russia while preparing for potential conflict with Austria.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria is open to a non-aggression pact in the Balkans, which aligns with our interest in securing Rumania. England is interested in peace in the north, but our move to the Baltic Sea might cause tension. Italy proposes a non-aggression pact, which could help focus on other fronts. Germany has not responded, which may indicate a lack of interest or other priorities. Turkey is focused on Bulgaria and Romania, suggesting potential conflict over these areas.

[S1901M] In Spring 1901, we issued orders to advance Army Moscow to Ukraine and Army Warsaw to Galicia, aiming to position ourselves for potential gains in Rumania and influence in Austria. Fleet Sevastopol moves to the Black Sea to challenge Turkey's naval presence, while Fleet St. Petersburg holds to maintain a northern defensive posture. Our strategy focuses on early expansion and managing southern threats.

[S1901M] Germany is seeking to establish a cooperative relationship with Austria to counter Russian influence, while also proposing a non-aggression pact with France. England has expressed a desire for cooperation in the North Sea, but Germany remains cautious due to England's unfriendly stance. Turkey is looking to expand in the Balkans, and Russia has proposed coordination in the north. France has not responded to Germany's outreach, indicating potential hostility or indifference.

[S1901M] Germany has issued orders to hold in Berlin, move the fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and hold in Munich. The intent is to secure Denmark for a stronger northern position while maintaining a defensive stance in Munich.

Current Goals: - Secure Tunis by moving the fleet from Ionian Sea to Tunis.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a tentative understanding with Austria to focus on different regions, with Austria focusing on the Balkans and Italy on the Mediterranean. Turkey expressed a desire for peaceful coexistence, but their focus on the Balkans could conflict with Austria's plans. France, Germany, England, and Russia have not responded, indicating possible indifference or prioritization of other alliances.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Naples to Ionian Sea and Army Rome to Apulia, while holding Army Venice. This positions Italy for a potential capture of Tunis and maintains a defensive stance in the north, aligning with the goal of Mediterranean expansion and securing a stable relationship with Austria.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is open to cooperation in the North Sea region, suggesting a mutual non-aggression stance. Russia has indicated a move to the Baltic Sea, which they claim is non-threatening. France has not responded to my proposal for peace and cooperation, which may indicate other priorities or potential hostility. Italy is focused on the Mediterranean and not a current concern.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move both fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, securing naval dominance and positioning for potential expansion into Norway. Moved the army from Liverpool to Yorkshire, preparing for future operations towards Belgium. Current strategy focuses on securing the North Sea and establishing a strong alliance with Germany to prevent a two-front conflict with France.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

  RUSSIA: Greetings! I hope this message finds you well. I am interested in exploring potential cooperation between our nations, especially in counterbalancing any aggressive moves from Germany or Austria. Please let me know if you are open to discussions.
END MESSAGES

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

gpt-4o-mini,TURKEY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Turkey is focused on securing Bulgaria and Romania, with positive discussions with Russia about potential cooperation. Italy expresses a desire for peaceful coexistence, while Austria remains unresponsive. Germany is open to alliances but has not engaged directly with Turkey. Overall, relationships with Austria and Italy are unfriendly, while Russia is friendly.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria for expansion and to strengthen ties with Russia while preparing for potential conflict with Austria.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Austria, England, Germany, Italy, and Russia about non-aggression pacts. Austria expressed interest in Rumania and Serbia, while Russia is open to cooperation against Austria. England and Germany are focused on their own regions but are open to non-aggression pacts. Italy is also focused on the Mediterranean but is willing to maintain communication. Overall, there is a cautious atmosphere with potential for cooperation, especially with Russia.

1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

- I will also move my fleet from Ankara (ANK) to the Black Sea (BLA) to position it for future moves towards Romania or to support my army in Bulgaria.
- The army in Smyrna (SMY) will hold its position for now, as it is not immediately needed for the current moves but can support future actions.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is seeking to establish a cooperative relationship with Austria to counter Russian influence, while also proposing a non-aggression pact with France. England has expressed a desire for cooperation in the North Sea, but Germany remains cautious due to England's unfriendly stance. Turkey is looking to expand in the Balkans, and Russia has proposed coordination in the north. France has not responded to Germany's outreach, indicating potential hostility or indifference.

[S1901M] Germany has issued orders to hold in Berlin, move the fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and hold in Munich. The intent is to secure Denmark for a stronger northern position while maintaining a defensive stance in Munich.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Italy about potential cooperation in the Mediterranean, but no specific agreements were reached. Russia expressed interest in coordination in the north, but further details are pending. Turkey is open to a non-aggression pact, indicating a willingness to maintain communication. France has not responded to outreach, suggesting potential hostility. Overall, relationships remain cautious with Italy and Turkey, while Russia is viewed as an enemy.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ITALY:
  GERMANY: Hello! I appreciate your outreach. While my focus is primarily on Northern Europe, I believe we can find common ground. If you are looking to expand in the Mediterranean, I would be interested in discussing how we can avoid conflicts and perhaps support each other's interests.
  ITALY: Greetings Germany, I am interested in discussing potential areas of cooperation. As Italy, my focus is on the Mediterranean, but I am open to exploring mutual interests that could benefit both our positions. Let me know if you have any specific proposals in mind.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  GERMANY: Greetings! I appreciate your proposal for coordination in the north. I am planning to move my fleet from Denmark and would like to ensure our movements do not conflict. Let's keep communication open to ensure mutual growth and security.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  GERMANY: Hello Turkey! I see you are looking to expand in the Balkans. While my focus is more towards the West, I would be open to discussing a non-aggression pact to ensure our borders remain secure. Let’s keep the lines of communication open.
  TURKEY: Hello! I see you are looking to strengthen your position in Northern Europe. While my focus is currently on the Balkans, I am open to discussing potential cooperation in the future. It could be beneficial for both of us to keep lines of communication open.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles
    - Paris
  Germany
    - Berlin
    - Kiel
    - Munich
  Italy
    - Naples
    - Rome
    - Venice
  Russia
    - Moscow
    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Belgium (BEL) and strengthen my position in Northern Europe. To achieve this, I will move my fleet from Denmark (DEN) to the North Sea (NTH) to prepare for a potential move towards Belgium.
- I will also move my army from Munich (MUN) to Burgundy (BUR) to position myself for future expansion towards France while maintaining a defensive hold in Berlin (BER).
- Holding in Berlin (BER) is crucial to protect my home center from any potential threats from Russia or Austria.
- The fleet in Denmark (DEN) will support my future moves towards Belgium and potentially counter any English aggression.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN - BUR"",
    ""F DEN - NTH""

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure Serbia to increase supply centers and strengthen position in the Balkans.
- Coordinate with Italy to counterbalance threats from Germany and Russia.
- Prepare defenses against potential aggression from Germany while seeking opportunities to expand into German territories.
Relationships: - ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a friendly alliance with Italy to secure the Balkans, with Italy focusing on the Mediterranean. Germany expressed interest in a neutral stance but is seen as unfriendly. Russia is open to cooperation but has conflicting interests in Romania. Turkey seeks a peaceful relationship but is also eyeing the Balkans. No responses from England or France, indicating potential indifference or prioritization of other relationships.

[S1901M] Austria aims to secure Rumania with A BUD moving there, while F TRI holds defensively. A VIE supports A MUN into BOH, strengthening the position against Germany and fostering an alliance with Italy.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Russia about cooperation in the Balkans, proposing mutual support for Rumania and Serbia. Turkey was approached for a non-aggression pact to avoid conflict over Rumania and Serbia. Italy reaffirmed their commitment to stability in the Balkans, indicating a strong alliance. No responses were received from Russia and Turkey, which may indicate a lack of commitment or prioritization of other relationships.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  AUSTRIA: Greetings! I appreciate your interest in cooperation in the Balkans. I am also looking to secure Rumania, and I believe we can find a way to support each other's growth. Perhaps we can agree that you focus on Rumania while I secure Serbia? This way, we can both expand without conflict.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  AUSTRIA: Hello, Turkey. I value your intention to maintain a peaceful relationship. However, I must express my interest in securing both Rumania and Serbia. I propose we discuss a non-aggression pact to ensure our interests do not conflict in the Balkans. Let's work together to avoid any misunderstandings.

  ITALY: Dear Austria, I hope our understanding remains strong. I am committed to focusing on the Mediterranean and supporting stability in the Balkans. Please let me know if there are any developments or concerns on your end that we should discuss.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

- My primary goal is to secure Serbia (SER) to increase my supply centers and strengthen my position in the Balkans. I will move my army from Rumania (RUM) to Serbia, as it is a neutral center that I can capture.
- I will also support my move to Serbia with my army in Vienna (A VIE) to ensure a successful capture, as there is a potential threat from Turkey in the region.
- The fleet in Trieste (F TRI) will hold defensively to protect against any potential Italian aggression or to support my army in the future if needed.
- I will also keep my options open for future moves towards Rumania or other territories, depending on how the situation develops with Russia and Turkey.

gpt-4o,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a tentative understanding with Austria to focus on different regions, with Austria focusing on the Balkans and Italy on the Mediterranean. Turkey expressed a desire for peaceful coexistence, but their focus on the Balkans could conflict with Austria's plans. France, Germany, England, and Russia have not responded, indicating possible indifference or prioritization of other alliances.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Naples to Ionian Sea and Army Rome to Apulia, while holding Army Venice. This positions Italy for a potential capture of Tunis and maintains a defensive stance in the north, aligning with the goal of Mediterranean expansion and securing a stable relationship with Austria.

[F1901M] Established a non-aggression pact with Russia and agreed to maintain peaceful relations with Turkey. Germany is open to cooperation in the Mediterranean, while England is open to future opportunities. Austria has not responded to recent messages, and France has not responded to any messages, indicating potential indifference or other priorities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Secure Tunis:** The primary goal for this phase is to secure the neutral supply center of Tunis. This will be achieved by moving the fleet from the Ionian Sea to Tunis. This move is crucial for Italy's early expansion and control of the Mediterranean.

2. **Maintain Stability with Austria:** Given the friendly relationship with Austria and the strategic importance of maintaining stability in the Balkans, I will avoid any aggressive moves towards Austrian territories. Instead, I will focus on consolidating my position in Italy.

3. **Defensive Positioning:** With France being unfriendly and not responding to communications, there is a potential threat from the west. Therefore, I will position my units defensively to protect against any French aggression.

4. **Orders for Units:**
   - **Fleet in Ionian Sea (F ION):** Move to Tunis to secure the supply center.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria is open to a non-aggression pact in the Balkans, which aligns with our interest in securing Rumania. England is interested in peace in the north, but our move to the Baltic Sea might cause tension. Italy proposes a non-aggression pact, which could help focus on other fronts. Germany has not responded, which may indicate a lack of interest or other priorities. Turkey is focused on Bulgaria and Romania, suggesting potential conflict over these areas.

[S1901M] In Spring 1901, we issued orders to advance Army Moscow to Ukraine and Army Warsaw to Galicia, aiming to position ourselves for potential gains in Rumania and influence in Austria. Fleet Sevastopol moves to the Black Sea to challenge Turkey's naval presence, while Fleet St. Petersburg holds to maintain a northern defensive posture. Our strategy focuses on early expansion and managing southern threats.

[F1901M] Austria and Turkey both express interest in Rumania, with Austria suggesting a division of the Balkans and Turkey proposing cooperation against Austria. England and Germany are open to maintaining peace in the north, but Germany's movements need careful monitoring. Italy has not responded to the non-aggression pact proposal, and France has not replied to the offer of cooperation against Germany or Austria.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles
    - Paris

  Russia
    - Moscow
    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Secure Rumania:** The primary goal for this phase is to secure Rumania, a neutral supply center. Given the current positions, Austria has an army in Rumania, which complicates the situation. However, we can use our units to support a move into Rumania.

2. **Manage the Black Sea Standoff:** The fleet in Sevastopol should attempt to move to the Black Sea to challenge Turkey's naval presence. This move is crucial to maintain pressure on Turkey and potentially support future operations in the Balkans.

3. **Defend and Position in the North:** The army in Ukraine should support the move into Rumania to ensure success. Meanwhile, the army in Galicia should hold its position to maintain pressure on Austria and defend against any potential aggression.

4. **Diplomatic Considerations:** We have ongoing discussions with Austria and Turkey regarding the Balkans. While Austria suggests focusing on Serbia, Turkey is interested in cooperation against Austria. Our moves should reflect a balance between these diplomatic engagements and our strategic goals.

**Orders:**

- **A UKR - RUM:** Move the army from Ukraine to Rumania to attempt to take control of this supply center.
- **A GAL S A UKR - RUM:** Support the move from Ukraine to Rumania with the army in Galicia to increase the chances of success.
- **F SEV - BLA:** Move the fleet from Sevastopol to the Black Sea to challenge Turkey's naval presence and maintain strategic flexibility in the region.
- **F STP/SC H:** Hold the fleet in St. Petersburg to maintain a defensive posture in the north and ensure security against potential threats from Germany or England.

gpt-4o,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is open to cooperation in the North Sea region, suggesting a mutual non-aggression stance. Russia has indicated a move to the Baltic Sea, which they claim is non-threatening. France has not responded to my proposal for peace and cooperation, which may indicate other priorities or potential hostility. Italy is focused on the Mediterranean and not a current concern.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move both fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, securing naval dominance and positioning for potential expansion into Norway. Moved the army from Liverpool to Yorkshire, preparing for future operations towards Belgium. Current strategy focuses on securing the North Sea and establishing a strong alliance with Germany to prevent a two-front conflict with France.

[F1901M] No significant agreements reached. Italy, Russia, and Turkey have not responded to my messages, indicating possible indifference or other priorities. France's continued silence suggests potential hostility or disinterest in cooperation. Germany remains the only engaged power, suggesting a potential ally.

3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As England, my primary objectives for this phase are to secure the North Sea and position myself for future expansion into Norway and potentially Belgium. Given the current diplomatic landscape, with France being unfriendly and Germany being a potential ally, I need to ensure that I maintain a strong naval presence to deter any French aggression and to support my expansion plans.

1. **Fleet in Edinburgh (F EDI):** The most strategic move is to secure the North Sea (NTH). This move is crucial for maintaining naval dominance and for future operations towards Norway. It also positions me to support any future moves into Belgium or Denmark.

2. **Fleet in London (F LON):** Moving this fleet to the North Sea (NTH) as well will reinforce my naval presence and ensure that I have control over this critical area. This move also allows for flexibility in supporting future operations or defending against potential threats.

3. **Army in Yorkshire (A YOR):** The army will move to London (LON). This move prepares the army for potential future operations towards Belgium or to defend against any unexpected threats. It also keeps my options open for building additional fleets in the future if needed.

By focusing on securing the North Sea and positioning my units for future expansion, I am aligning with my strategic goals of proactive expansion and calculated aggression. This setup also allows me to maintain a strong defensive posture against any potential French moves.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
The Tsar strikes first: Galicia backs Ukraine and Russia storms into Rumania, yanking the center from under Austria’s nose while Vienna sidesteps into Serbia to keep pace. Out west the Kaiser lands a haymaker, springing Munich into Burgundy—now staring straight at Paris—as Denmark locks in Germany’s fourth star. Italy surges through the Ionian to hoist the tricolore over Tunis, Turkey bunkers in Smyrna and Bulgaria after another fiery Black Sea bounce, and France huddles on full alert. The North Sea turns into a fender-bending pile-up of English and German hulls, so with England stalled the early momentum thunderously belongs to Russia and Germany!

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
The Tsar strikes first: Galicia backs Ukraine and Russia storms into Rumania, yanking the center from under Austria’s nose while Vienna sidesteps into Serbia to keep pace. Out west the Kaiser lands a haymaker, springing Munich into Burgundy—now staring straight at Paris—as Denmark locks in Germany’s fourth star. Italy surges through the Ionian to hoist the tricolore over Tunis, Turkey bunkers in Smyrna and Bulgaria after another fiery Black Sea bounce, and France huddles on full alert. The North Sea turns into a fender-bending pile-up of English and German hulls, so with England stalled the early momentum thunderously belongs to Russia and Germany!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure Rumania by moving Sevastopol to Rumania or supporting a move from Ukraine.
- Attempt to negotiate with Turkey to resolve the Black Sea standoff.
- Consider supporting Italy's southern expansion to maintain their focus away from Russia.
- Prepare defenses in Warsaw and St. Petersburg to counter potential German aggression.
- Explore diplomatic options with France to potentially counterbalance German and Austrian threats.

Board State:


PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
The Tsar strikes first: Galicia backs Ukraine and Russia storms into Rumania, yanking the center from under Austria’s nose while Vienna sidesteps into Serbia to keep pace. Out west the Kaiser lands a haymaker, springing Munich into Burgundy—now staring straight at Paris—as Denmark locks in Germany’s fourth star. Italy surges through the Ionian to hoist the tricolore over Tunis, Turkey bunkers in Smyrna and Bulgaria after another fiery Black Sea bounce, and France huddles on full alert. The North Sea turns into a fender-bending pile-up of English and German hulls, so with England stalled the early momentum thunderously belongs to Russia and Germany!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Regain control of the North Sea to prevent French advantage.
- Secure Norway to increase supply centers and strengthen northern position.
- Maintain and strengthen the relationship with Germany to prevent a two-front war.
- Monitor Russian movements for potential threats to northern territories.
- Explore diplomatic opportunities with Italy and Turkey to counterbalance potential Franco-German cooperation.

gpt-4o-mini,TURKEY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

[S1901M] Established a friendly alliance with Italy to secure the Balkans, with Italy focusing on the Mediterranean. Germany expressed interest in a neutral stance but is seen as unfriendly. Russia is open to cooperation but has conflicting interests in Romania. Turkey seeks a peaceful relationship but is also eyeing the Balkans. No responses from England or France, indicating potential indifference or prioritization of other relationships.

[S1901M] Austria aims to secure Rumania with A BUD moving there, while F TRI holds defensively. A VIE supports A MUN into BOH, strengthening the position against Germany and fostering an alliance with Italy.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Russia about cooperation in the Balkans, proposing mutual support for Rumania and Serbia. Turkey was approached for a non-aggression pact to avoid conflict over Rumania and Serbia. Italy reaffirmed their commitment to stability in the Balkans, indicating a strong alliance. No responses were received from Russia and Turkey, which may indicate a lack of commitment or prioritization of other relationships.

[F1901M] Austria has issued orders to advance into Serbia with the army from Rumania, hold the fleet in Trieste, and support the army in Munich from Vienna. The primary goal is to secure Serbia for an additional supply center while maintaining a defensive posture against Germany and fostering cooperation with Italy.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria is open to a non-aggression pact in the Balkans, which aligns with our interest in securing Rumania. England is interested in peace in the north, but our move to the Baltic Sea might cause tension. Italy proposes a non-aggression pact, which could help focus on other fronts. Germany has not responded, which may indicate a lack of interest or other priorities. Turkey is focused on Bulgaria and Romania, suggesting potential conflict over these areas.

[S1901M] In Spring 1901, we issued orders to advance Army Moscow to Ukraine and Army Warsaw to Galicia, aiming to position ourselves for potential gains in Rumania and influence in Austria. Fleet Sevastopol moves to the Black Sea to challenge Turkey's naval presence, while Fleet St. Petersburg holds to maintain a northern defensive posture. Our strategy focuses on early expansion and managing southern threats.

[F1901M] Austria and Turkey both express interest in Rumania, with Austria suggesting a division of the Balkans and Turkey proposing cooperation against Austria. England and Germany are open to maintaining peace in the north, but Germany's movements need careful monitoring. Italy has not responded to the non-aggression pact proposal, and France has not replied to the offer of cooperation against Germany or Austria.

[F1901M] Issued orders to secure Rumania by moving A UKR to RUM with support from A GAL. Attempting to gain control of the Black Sea by moving F SEV to BLA. Holding F STP/SC to maintain a defensive position against potential threats from Germany. Strategic intent focuses on expanding into Rumania while managing tensions with Turkey and preparing for possible German aggression.

In the Winter 1901 Adjustment phase, our primary goal is to build units that will strengthen our position and support our strategic objectives. We have successfully secured Rumania, and we need to focus on reinforcing our presence in both the north and south. Given the current diplomatic landscape and our relationships with other powers, we should prioritize building units that will allow us to defend our territories and prepare for future expansion.

1. **Build in St. Petersburg (F STP/SC B):** This fleet will help us maintain a strong defensive posture in the north, particularly against potential threats from Germany or England. It also provides flexibility for future operations in the Baltic Sea or Norwegian Sea.

2. **Build in Sevastopol (F SEV B):** This fleet will reinforce our position in the Black Sea, allowing us to counter any Turkish aggression and potentially support operations in the Balkans.

3. **Build in Moscow (A MOS B):** An additional army in Moscow will provide us with flexibility to support operations in the south or reinforce our defenses in the north, depending on how the situation develops.

These builds align with our strategic goals of securing our current territories, preparing for potential conflicts, and positioning ourselves for future expansion.

[S1901M] Established a tentative understanding with Austria to focus on different regions, with Austria focusing on the Balkans and Italy on the Mediterranean. Turkey expressed a desire for peaceful coexistence, but their focus on the Balkans could conflict with Austria's plans. France, Germany, England, and Russia have not responded, indicating possible indifference or prioritization of other alliances.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Naples to Ionian Sea and Army Rome to Apulia, while holding Army Venice. This positions Italy for a potential capture of Tunis and maintains a defensive stance in the north, aligning with the goal of Mediterranean expansion and securing a stable relationship with Austria.

[F1901M] Established a non-aggression pact with Russia and agreed to maintain peaceful relations with Turkey. Germany is open to cooperation in the Mediterranean, while England is open to future opportunities. Austria has not responded to recent messages, and France has not responded to any messages, indicating potential indifference or other priorities.

[F1901M] Issued orders to secure Tunis by moving the fleet from Ionian Sea to Tunis, consolidate control over Naples by moving the army from Apulia to Naples, and hold position in Venice to maintain a defensive stance. The strategic intent is to expand into Tunis while maintaining stability in Italy and fostering a friendly relationship with Austria.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Italy in the Winter 1901 Adjustment phase, my primary focus is on building units to strengthen my position and prepare for future expansion. I have successfully secured Tunis, which provides an additional supply center, allowing me to build one new unit. Given the current diplomatic landscape and my strategic goals, I need to consider the following:

1. **Defensive Posture in the North:** With Austria as a friendly power and no immediate threats from Germany, I can afford to maintain a defensive stance in Venice. However, I should remain vigilant of potential French aggression.

2. **Naval Expansion:** Controlling the Mediterranean is crucial for Italy. Building a fleet will allow me to project power into the Western Mediterranean and potentially threaten France or support operations against Turkey.

3. **Future Opportunities:** A fleet in Naples can be used to either support operations in the Mediterranean or pivot towards the Adriatic if relations with Austria sour.

Given these considerations, I will build a fleet in Naples to enhance my naval capabilities and prepare for future expansion opportunities.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Russia roars out of the gates, slapping a fifth banner on the map and planting flags from Sevastopol to Warsaw, instantly painting a target on the Tsar’s back. Germany, Austria, Italy, and Turkey scramble in a four-way deadlock at four centers apiece, each eyeing the others’ soft underbellies while England and France nurse their bruises on a modest three. The quiet winter hides simmering tension—Galicia and Rumania now bristle with Russian steel, and Vienna can practically hear the boots marching. Get ready, folks: the board is a powder keg, and Spring 1902 promises the spark!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure Rumania by supporting it with Sevastopol or Ukraine.
- Negotiate with Turkey to resolve the Black Sea standoff and explore potential cooperation.
- Strengthen diplomatic ties with France to counterbalance German aggression.
- Monitor Germany's movements and prepare defenses in Warsaw and St. Petersburg.
- Encourage Italy to continue focusing on the west to keep them from interfering in the east.

[S1901M] Germany is seeking to establish a cooperative relationship with Austria to counter Russian influence, while also proposing a non-aggression pact with France. England has expressed a desire for cooperation in the North Sea, but Germany remains cautious due to England's unfriendly stance. Turkey is looking to expand in the Balkans, and Russia has proposed coordination in the north. France has not responded to Germany's outreach, indicating potential hostility or indifference.

[S1901M] Germany has issued orders to hold in Berlin, move the fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and hold in Munich. The intent is to secure Denmark for a stronger northern position while maintaining a defensive stance in Munich.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Italy about potential cooperation in the Mediterranean, but no specific agreements were reached. Russia expressed interest in coordination in the north, but further details are pending. Turkey is open to a non-aggression pact, indicating a willingness to maintain communication. France has not responded to outreach, suggesting potential hostility. Overall, relationships remain cautious with Italy and Turkey, while Russia is viewed as an enemy.

[F1901M] Germany has issued orders to hold in Berlin, move from Munich to Burgundy, and advance from Denmark to the North Sea. The intent is to secure Belgium while positioning for potential conflict with France and maintaining a strong alliance with Austria against Russian influence.

[W1901A] Germany issued waives for the first turn, focusing on building relationships and assessing the strategic landscape. The intent is to secure Belgium in the next phase and strengthen ties with Austria while monitoring potential threats from Russia and France.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a friendly alliance with Italy to secure the Balkans, with Italy focusing on the Mediterranean. Germany expressed interest in a neutral stance but is seen as unfriendly. Russia is open to cooperation but has conflicting interests in Romania. Turkey seeks a peaceful relationship but is also eyeing the Balkans. No responses from England or France, indicating potential indifference or prioritization of other relationships.

[S1901M] Austria aims to secure Rumania with A BUD moving there, while F TRI holds defensively. A VIE supports A MUN into BOH, strengthening the position against Germany and fostering an alliance with Italy.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Russia about cooperation in the Balkans, proposing mutual support for Rumania and Serbia. Turkey was approached for a non-aggression pact to avoid conflict over Rumania and Serbia. Italy reaffirmed their commitment to stability in the Balkans, indicating a strong alliance. No responses were received from Russia and Turkey, which may indicate a lack of commitment or prioritization of other relationships.

[F1901M] Austria has issued orders to advance into Serbia with the army from Rumania, hold the fleet in Trieste, and support the army in Munich from Vienna. The primary goal is to secure Serbia for an additional supply center while maintaining a defensive posture against Germany and fostering cooperation with Italy.

[W1901A] Waived orders in the first turn to maintain flexibility and assess the political landscape. Focus remains on securing Serbia in the next phase and strengthening alliance with Italy to counter threats from Germany and Russia.

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure control of Bulgaria and Rumania to strengthen my position in the Balkans.
- Coordinate with Russia to counter Austria's aggression and prevent their expansion.
- Position units strategically in the region to prepare for potential conflict with Austria.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Turkey is focused on securing Bulgaria and Romania, with positive discussions with Russia about potential cooperation. Italy expresses a desire for peaceful coexistence, while Austria remains unresponsive. Germany is open to alliances but has not engaged directly with Turkey. Overall, relationships with Austria and Italy are unfriendly, while Russia is friendly.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria for expansion and to strengthen ties with Russia while preparing for potential conflict with Austria.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Austria, England, Germany, Italy, and Russia about non-aggression pacts. Austria expressed interest in Rumania and Serbia, while Russia is open to cooperation against Austria. England and Germany are focused on their own regions but are open to non-aggression pacts. Italy is also focused on the Mediterranean but is willing to maintain communication. Overall, there is a cautious atmosphere with potential for cooperation, especially with Russia.

[F1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, hold the army in Smyrna, and hold the army in Bulgaria. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria and prepare for potential conflict with Austria while maintaining a friendly relationship with Russia.

[W1901A] Waived orders in the first turn to maintain flexibility and assess the political landscape. Focus remains on securing Bulgaria and Rumania, while coordinating with Russia to counter Austria's potential aggression.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria is open to a non-aggression pact in the Balkans, which aligns with our interest in securing Rumania. England is interested in peace in the north, but our move to the Baltic Sea might cause tension. Italy proposes a non-aggression pact, which could help focus on other fronts. Germany has not responded, which may indicate a lack of interest or other priorities. Turkey is focused on Bulgaria and Romania, suggesting potential conflict over these areas.

[S1901M] In Spring 1901, we issued orders to advance Army Moscow to Ukraine and Army Warsaw to Galicia, aiming to position ourselves for potential gains in Rumania and influence in Austria. Fleet Sevastopol moves to the Black Sea to challenge Turkey's naval presence, while Fleet St. Petersburg holds to maintain a northern defensive posture. Our strategy focuses on early expansion and managing southern threats.

[F1901M] Austria and Turkey both express interest in Rumania, with Austria suggesting a division of the Balkans and Turkey proposing cooperation against Austria. England and Germany are open to maintaining peace in the north, but Germany's movements need careful monitoring. Italy has not responded to the non-aggression pact proposal, and France has not replied to the offer of cooperation against Germany or Austria.

[F1901M] Issued orders to secure Rumania by moving A UKR to RUM with support from A GAL. Attempting to gain control of the Black Sea by moving F SEV to BLA. Holding F STP/SC to maintain a defensive position against potential threats from Germany. Strategic intent focuses on expanding into Rumania while managing tensions with Turkey and preparing for possible German aggression.

[W1901A] Issued orders to build an army in Moscow and waived the second build. The strategic intent is to strengthen our position in the south and prepare for potential conflicts with Austria and Turkey. The focus is on securing Rumania and maintaining flexibility for future moves.

Power: ITALY
Phase: S1902M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and consolidate control over Tunis.
- Strengthen diplomatic ties with Austria to form a coalition against Russia.
- Coordinate with Germany to apply pressure on France and potentially gain support in the Western Mediterranean.
- Monitor Turkey's actions and consider aligning with them if they oppose Russia.
- Prepare defenses against potential French aggression in the Western Mediterranean.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a tentative understanding with Austria to focus on different regions, with Austria focusing on the Balkans and Italy on the Mediterranean. Turkey expressed a desire for peaceful coexistence, but their focus on the Balkans could conflict with Austria's plans. France, Germany, England, and Russia have not responded, indicating possible indifference or prioritization of other alliances.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Naples to Ionian Sea and Army Rome to Apulia, while holding Army Venice. This positions Italy for a potential capture of Tunis and maintains a defensive stance in the north, aligning with the goal of Mediterranean expansion and securing a stable relationship with Austria.

[F1901M] Established a non-aggression pact with Russia and agreed to maintain peaceful relations with Turkey. Germany is open to cooperation in the Mediterranean, while England is open to future opportunities. Austria has not responded to recent messages, and France has not responded to any messages, indicating potential indifference or other priorities.

[F1901M] Issued orders to secure Tunis by moving the fleet from Ionian Sea to Tunis, consolidate control over Naples by moving the army from Apulia to Naples, and hold position in Venice to maintain a defensive stance. The strategic intent is to expand into Tunis while maintaining stability in Italy and fostering a friendly relationship with Austria.

[W1901A] Waived build order to maintain current unit distribution, focusing on consolidating control over Tunis and preparing for future expansion. Strengthening diplomatic ties with Austria to counter Russian influence in the Balkans, while monitoring Germany's actions for potential alignment against France. Remaining vigilant of France's movements to defend against any threats.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is open to cooperation in the North Sea region, suggesting a mutual non-aggression stance. Russia has indicated a move to the Baltic Sea, which they claim is non-threatening. France has not responded to my proposal for peace and cooperation, which may indicate other priorities or potential hostility. Italy is focused on the Mediterranean and not a current concern.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move both fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, securing naval dominance and positioning for potential expansion into Norway. Moved the army from Liverpool to Yorkshire, preparing for future operations towards Belgium. Current strategy focuses on securing the North Sea and establishing a strong alliance with Germany to prevent a two-front conflict with France.

[F1901M] No significant agreements reached. Italy, Russia, and Turkey have not responded to my messages, indicating possible indifference or other priorities. France's continued silence suggests potential hostility or disinterest in cooperation. Germany remains the only engaged power, suggesting a potential ally.

[F1901M] Issued orders to consolidate control over the North Sea by moving both fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, while repositioning the army from Yorkshire to London. This aims to secure a strategic naval position and prepare for future expansion into Norway, while maintaining a defensive stance against potential French aggression.

{""negotiation_summary"": ""Germany is keen on an anti-Russian alliance, offering support into Sevastopol (SEV) if I attack.

{""negotiation_summary"": ""France continues to ignore my alliance proposals regarding Belgium and the Channel, having not responded to messages in the last two phases.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1902M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria for expansion and to strengthen ties with Russia while preparing for potential conflict with Austria.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Austria, England, Germany, Italy, and Russia about non-aggression pacts. Austria expressed interest in Rumania and Serbia, while Russia is open to cooperation against Austria. England and Germany are focused on their own regions but are open to non-aggression pacts. Italy is also focused on the Mediterranean but is willing to maintain communication. Overall, there is a cautious atmosphere with potential for cooperation, especially with Russia.

[F1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, hold the army in Smyrna, and hold the army in Bulgaria. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria and prepare for potential conflict with Austria while maintaining a friendly relationship with Russia.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,S1902M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a friendly alliance with Italy to secure the Balkans, with Italy focusing on the Mediterranean. Germany expressed interest in a neutral stance but is seen as unfriendly. Russia is open to cooperation but has conflicting interests in Romania. Turkey seeks a peaceful relationship but is also eyeing the Balkans. No responses from England or France, indicating potential indifference or prioritization of other relationships.

[S1901M] Austria aims to secure Rumania with A BUD moving there, while F TRI holds defensively. A VIE supports A MUN into BOH, strengthening the position against Germany and fostering an alliance with Italy.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Russia about cooperation in the Balkans, proposing mutual support for Rumania and Serbia. Turkey was approached for a non-aggression pact to avoid conflict over Rumania and Serbia. Italy reaffirmed their commitment to stability in the Balkans, indicating a strong alliance. No responses were received from Russia and Turkey, which may indicate a lack of commitment or prioritization of other relationships.

[F1901M] Austria has issued orders to advance into Serbia with the army from Rumania, hold the fleet in Trieste, and support the army in Munich from Vienna. The primary goal is to secure Serbia for an additional supply center while maintaining a defensive posture against Germany and fostering cooperation with Italy.

[W1901A] Waived orders in the first turn to maintain flexibility and assess the political landscape. Focus remains on securing Serbia in the next phase and strengthening alliance with Italy to counter threats from Germany and Russia.

[S1902M] Austria is focused on securing Serbia and has communicated this to Italy, seeking support against Germany. Italy has proposed a united front against Russia, indicating a potential shift in focus. Turkey is open to a non-aggression pact, while Germany is focused on Belgium, which may indicate a lack of interest in the Balkans. Russia has not responded to Austria's proposal for cooperation in the Balkans, which may suggest hostility or indifference.

MESSAGES THIS ROUND
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 AUSTRIA: To all powers: I am focused on securing my position in the Balkans and will be moving to solidify my control over Serbia. I hope for peaceful relations with all, but I will defend my interests vigorously.
 TURKEY: To all powers: I am committed to maintaining peace in the region and focusing on mutual growth. I am open to discussions about non-aggression pacts and potential alliances to ensure stability in the Balkans.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ITALY:
  AUSTRIA: Hey Italy, I hope our alliance continues to strengthen. I plan to secure Serbia this turn, and I would appreciate your support in keeping the pressure on Germany. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure we both benefit from our positions in the Balkans and the Mediterranean.
  ITALY: Greetings! I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to strengthen our alliance, I propose we coordinate our efforts against Russia. Their presence in the Balkans is concerning, and a united front could be beneficial for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello Russia, I believe we can find common ground in the Balkans. If you can hold Romania, I can focus on Serbia and we can both expand our influence without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hello Austria, I hope our alliance continues to strengthen. I plan to secure Belgium this turn, which will bolster our position against Russia. Let's keep our lines of communication open and coordinate our efforts to counter any threats from the north.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  TURKEY: I wanted to reach out to discuss our positions. I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to avoid conflict in the Balkans. Perhaps we can agree on a non-aggression pact while we focus on our respective expansions?

    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Serbia (SER) this turn to increase my supply centers and strengthen my position in the Balkans. I will move my army from Rumania (RUM) to Serbia, which is currently unoccupied and will provide me with an additional supply center.
- I will hold my fleet in Trieste (F TRI) to maintain a defensive posture and support my army in Serbia if needed. This will also allow me to respond to any potential threats from Italy or Turkey.
- My army in Vienna (A VIE) will support the move to Serbia from Rumania, ensuring that I can take control of it without interference.
- I will also communicate with Italy to ensure that our alliance remains strong and that we can coordinate our efforts against any potential threats from Germany or Russia.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is open to cooperation in the North Sea region, suggesting a mutual non-aggression stance. Russia has indicated a move to the Baltic Sea, which they claim is non-threatening. France has not responded to my proposal for peace and cooperation, which may indicate other priorities or potential hostility. Italy is focused on the Mediterranean and not a current concern.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move both fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, securing naval dominance and positioning for potential expansion into Norway. Moved the army from Liverpool to Yorkshire, preparing for future operations towards Belgium. Current strategy focuses on securing the North Sea and establishing a strong alliance with Germany to prevent a two-front conflict with France.

[F1901M] No significant agreements reached. Italy, Russia, and Turkey have not responded to my messages, indicating possible indifference or other priorities. France's continued silence suggests potential hostility or disinterest in cooperation. Germany remains the only engaged power, suggesting a potential ally.

[F1901M] Issued orders to consolidate control over the North Sea by moving both fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, while repositioning the army from Yorkshire to London. This aims to secure a strategic naval position and prepare for future expansion into Norway, while maintaining a defensive stance against potential French aggression.

[S1902M] Germany has not responded to my proposal for a non-aggression pact in the North Sea and potential cooperation against France, indicating possible hostility or other priorities. Russia expressed interest in maintaining peace in the north but did not commit to supporting my move into Norway, suggesting caution. Italy and Turkey have not responded to my outreach, which may indicate indifference or focus elsewhere. Austria and Turkey are focused on the Balkans, as per their global messages.

    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Primary Objective:** Secure the North Sea (NTH) to maintain naval dominance and prepare for expansion into Norway. This is crucial for both defense and future offensive operations.

2. **Fleet Movements:**
   - Move the fleet from Edinburgh (F EDI) to the North Sea (NTH) to regain control and position for potential support or attack on Norway.
   - Move the fleet from London (F LON) to the North Sea (NTH) to reinforce naval presence and ensure control over this critical area.

3. **Army Movements:**
   - Move the army from Yorkshire (A YOR) to London (LON) to consolidate forces and prepare for potential future operations towards Belgium or to defend against any unexpected threats.

4. **Diplomatic Considerations:**
   - Germany's lack of response suggests potential hostility or other priorities, so securing the North Sea is essential to counter any German naval movements.
   - Russia's neutral stance and interest in peace in the north suggest they may not interfere with my move into Norway, allowing me to focus on securing the North Sea.

gpt-4o,RUSSIA,S1902M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria is open to a non-aggression pact in the Balkans, which aligns with our interest in securing Rumania. England is interested in peace in the north, but our move to the Baltic Sea might cause tension. Italy proposes a non-aggression pact, which could help focus on other fronts. Germany has not responded, which may indicate a lack of interest or other priorities. Turkey is focused on Bulgaria and Romania, suggesting potential conflict over these areas.

[S1901M] In Spring 1901, we issued orders to advance Army Moscow to Ukraine and Army Warsaw to Galicia, aiming to position ourselves for potential gains in Rumania and influence in Austria. Fleet Sevastopol moves to the Black Sea to challenge Turkey's naval presence, while Fleet St. Petersburg holds to maintain a northern defensive posture. Our strategy focuses on early expansion and managing southern threats.

[F1901M] Austria and Turkey both express interest in Rumania, with Austria suggesting a division of the Balkans and Turkey proposing cooperation against Austria. England and Germany are open to maintaining peace in the north, but Germany's movements need careful monitoring. Italy has not responded to the non-aggression pact proposal, and France has not replied to the offer of cooperation against Germany or Austria.

[F1901M] Issued orders to secure Rumania by moving A UKR to RUM with support from A GAL. Attempting to gain control of the Black Sea by moving F SEV to BLA. Holding F STP/SC to maintain a defensive position against potential threats from Germany. Strategic intent focuses on expanding into Rumania while managing tensions with Turkey and preparing for possible German aggression.

[W1901A] Issued orders to build an army in Moscow and waived the second build. The strategic intent is to strengthen our position in the south and prepare for potential conflicts with Austria and Turkey. The focus is on securing Rumania and maintaining flexibility for future moves.

[S1902M] Austria proposes a non-aggression understanding in the Balkans, suggesting Russia hold Romania while Austria focuses on Serbia. Turkey seeks Russian support for a move into Romania, indicating a potential conflict with Austria. England desires neutrality or support in Norway, offering cooperation elsewhere. France and Italy have not responded to recent messages, indicating possible indifference or other priorities.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Secure Rumania:** It's crucial to maintain control over Rumania as it is a strategic supply center. Given the current diplomatic situation, supporting Rumania with units from Sevastopol or Ukraine is essential to counter any potential aggression from Turkey or Austria.

2. **Black Sea Standoff:** The Black Sea is a critical area for naval control. While Turkey has proposed moving into Rumania, it's important to maintain a defensive posture in the Black Sea to prevent Turkish naval dominance. Therefore, moving Fleet Sevastopol to the Black Sea is a strategic move to assert control and deter Turkish aggression.

3. **Diplomatic Maneuvering:** Austria has proposed a non-aggression pact in the Balkans, which aligns with our current goal of holding Rumania. However, Turkey's request for support into Rumania suggests a potential conflict. It's important to maintain a balance and not overly commit to either side until a clearer advantage is visible.

4. **Defensive Posture in the North:** With Germany being unfriendly, it's important to maintain a defensive posture in Warsaw and St. Petersburg. Moving Army Moscow to Warsaw will strengthen our northern defenses against any potential German aggression.

5. **Potential Expansion:** While the focus is on securing current positions, it's also important to keep an eye on potential expansion opportunities. Moving Army Galicia to Budapest could be a bold move to exploit any Austrian weakness, but it must be weighed against the risk of overextension.

**Orders:**

- **A GAL - BUD:** Attempt to exploit any Austrian weakness and potentially gain a new supply center.
- **A MOS - WAR:** Strengthen northern defenses against potential German aggression.
- **A RUM H:** Hold Rumania to maintain control and counter any potential moves from Turkey or Austria.
- **F SEV - BLA:** Move to the Black Sea to assert naval control and deter Turkish aggression.
- **F STP/SC H:** Maintain a defensive posture in the north to guard against any threats from Germany.

gpt-4o,ITALY,S1902M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a tentative understanding with Austria to focus on different regions, with Austria focusing on the Balkans and Italy on the Mediterranean. Turkey expressed a desire for peaceful coexistence, but their focus on the Balkans could conflict with Austria's plans. France, Germany, England, and Russia have not responded, indicating possible indifference or prioritization of other alliances.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Naples to Ionian Sea and Army Rome to Apulia, while holding Army Venice. This positions Italy for a potential capture of Tunis and maintains a defensive stance in the north, aligning with the goal of Mediterranean expansion and securing a stable relationship with Austria.

[F1901M] Established a non-aggression pact with Russia and agreed to maintain peaceful relations with Turkey. Germany is open to cooperation in the Mediterranean, while England is open to future opportunities. Austria has not responded to recent messages, and France has not responded to any messages, indicating potential indifference or other priorities.

[F1901M] Issued orders to secure Tunis by moving the fleet from Ionian Sea to Tunis, consolidate control over Naples by moving the army from Apulia to Naples, and hold position in Venice to maintain a defensive stance. The strategic intent is to expand into Tunis while maintaining stability in Italy and fostering a friendly relationship with Austria.

[W1901A] Waived build order to maintain current unit distribution, focusing on consolidating control over Tunis and preparing for future expansion. Strengthening diplomatic ties with Austria to counter Russian influence in the Balkans, while monitoring Germany's actions for potential alignment against France. Remaining vigilant of France's movements to defend against any threats.

[S1902M] Austria is focused on securing Serbia and seeks Italian support against Germany, while Italy proposes a joint front against Russia. England is open to cooperation against a potential Franco-German alliance. Germany is interested in Mediterranean insights and potential coordination against France. Turkey is non-committal, and France has not responded, indicating possible indifference or hostility. Russia proposes maintaining a non-aggression pact, but their expansion into the Balkans is concerning.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Primary Objective:** Secure and consolidate control over Tunis while preparing for future expansion. Maintain a defensive stance in Italy and foster alliances to counter potential threats.

2. **Diplomatic Landscape:**
   - **Austria:** Friendly relations, but they are focused on the Balkans. We should support their efforts against Russia to maintain this alliance.
   - **Germany:** Friendly and open to cooperation against France. We should coordinate with them to apply pressure on France.
   - **France:** Unfriendly and non-communicative, indicating potential hostility. We need to prepare for possible aggression from them.
   - **Russia:** Enemy due to their expansion into the Balkans. We should work with Austria and potentially Turkey to counter their influence.
   - **Turkey:** Neutral but open to discussions. We should explore potential alignment against Russia.

3. **Strategic Moves:**
   - **A VEN - TRI:** Attempt to take Trieste from Austria. This move is aggressive but aligns with our goal of expansion and could weaken Austria's position, making them more reliant on our alliance.
   - **A NAP - APU:** Move the army to Apulia to position it for future support or defense.
   - **F TUN - WES:** Move the fleet to the Western Mediterranean to apply pressure on France and prepare for potential naval engagements.
   - **A NAP S A VEN - TRI:** Support the attack on Trieste to increase the chances of success.
