intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles

    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT

   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure control of the North Sea and the English Channel to facilitate expansion into Scandinavia and the Low Countries.
- I need to establish a strong alliance with France while keeping an eye on Germany, who is unfriendly.
- Capturing Belgium early is crucial to increase my supply centers and strengthen my position against Germany.
- I will move my fleet from Edinburgh (EDI) to the North Sea (NTH) to position myself for future moves towards Belgium and to support my fleet in London (LON) if needed.
- The fleet in London (LON) will also move to the North Sea (NTH) to consolidate my naval presence in that area.
- The army in Liverpool (LVP) will move to Yorkshire (YOR) to prepare for a potential move into Belgium or to support the fleet in the North Sea.

gpt-4o-mini,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure control of the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea to facilitate expansion into the Balkans.
- I will move my fleet from Naples (F NAP) to the Ionian Sea (F NAP - ION) to establish a strong naval presence and support future moves into Greece or Tunisia.
- The army in Rome (A ROM) will move to Apulia (A ROM - APU) to position itself for a potential attack on Serbia or to support the fleet in the Ionian Sea.
- The army in Venice (A VEN) will hold (A VEN H) to maintain a defensive position against Austria while also being able to support future moves into Trieste or other territories.
- This strategy allows me to secure the necessary sea control while positioning my armies for future expansion into the Balkans.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) as they are crucial for early expansion and will strengthen my position in Northern Europe.
- The fleet in Kiel (KIE) is well-positioned to move to Denmark (DEN) and can also support an army move to Holland (HOL) from Munich (MUN).
- The army in Berlin (BER) will hold to protect against any potential threats from Russia or Austria while also being able to support moves if needed.
- The army in Munich (MUN) will move to Holland (HOL) to secure that supply center.
- I will also consider the potential for future moves towards Belgium (BEL) and the Balkans, but my immediate focus is on securing DEN and HOL.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
And we’re off to the races—Austria cracks the starting gun by storming into Serbia while Germany snags Denmark, but everywhere else the board snarls into feints and face-offs! England delivers the blooper reel of the day, ramming BOTH home fleets into the North Sea and bouncing itself, leaving the channel wide open for future chaos. In the east, the Russo-Turkish honeymoon is already on the rocks as twin fleets deadlock in the Black Sea and armies smash into each other over Galicia, signaling nothing but bad blood ahead. Russia’s early four-center lead looks menacing, yet with every front ablaze and trust already shattered, momentum could flip faster than you can shout “Stab!”

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
And we’re off to the races—Austria cracks the starting gun by storming into Serbia while Germany snags Denmark, but everywhere else the board snarls into feints and face-offs! England delivers the blooper reel of the day, ramming BOTH home fleets into the North Sea and bouncing itself, leaving the channel wide open for future chaos. In the east, the Russo-Turkish honeymoon is already on the rocks as twin fleets deadlock in the Black Sea and armies smash into each other over Galicia, signaling nothing but bad blood ahead. Russia’s early four-center lead looks menacing, yet with every front ablaze and trust already shattered, momentum could flip faster than you can shout “Stab!”

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure control of Denmark and Holland to strengthen position in Northern Europe.
- Establish a strong alliance with Austria to counterbalance Russia and Italy.
- Expand influence in the Balkans by targeting vulnerable supply centers held by Austria.

GAME STATE
Year: 1901
Phase: S1901M
Board State:
Board State:


PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
And we’re off to the races—Austria cracks the starting gun by storming into Serbia while Germany snags Denmark, but everywhere else the board snarls into feints and face-offs! England delivers the blooper reel of the day, ramming BOTH home fleets into the North Sea and bouncing itself, leaving the channel wide open for future chaos. In the east, the Russo-Turkish honeymoon is already on the rocks as twin fleets deadlock in the Black Sea and armies smash into each other over Galicia, signaling nothing but bad blood ahead. Russia’s early four-center lead looks menacing, yet with every front ablaze and trust already shattered, momentum could flip faster than you can shout “Stab!”

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure control of the North Sea and the English Channel to facilitate expansion into Scandinavia and the Low Countries.
- Establish a strong alliance with France to counterbalance Germany and Russia, while keeping options open for future expansion.
- Aim to capture Belgium early to increase supply centers and strengthen position against Germany.

TASK
Analyze the phase summary and game state to update your relationships and goals.

IMPORTANT RULES
1. Update relationships for ALL powers in ['AUSTRIA', 'FRANCE', 'GERMANY', 'ITALY', 'RUSSIA', 'TURKEY']
2. Use ONLY these relationship values: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally
3. Make goals specific and actionable
4. Base analysis on actual events, not assumptions
5. Return ONLY valid JSON - no text before or after

  ""goals"": [
    ""Hold Warsaw against Russia"",

  ""goals"": [
    ""Counter French fleet"",
    ""Secure Norway with Russia"",

  },
  ""goals"": [
    ""Control northern waters"",
    ""Take Denmark first"",
    ""Find anti-Russia ally""
  ]
}

4. As England, after a failed attack on Belgium (BEL) which was occupied by France, supported by Germany. Russia moved into Sweden (SWE) uncontested. Austria and Italy skirmished over Trieste (TRI). Turkey was quiet.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""My attack on Belgium was decisively repulsed due to Franco-German cooperation, marking them as a significant threat bloc. Russia's acquisition of Sweden is concerning for my northern position. The Austro-Italian conflict seems localized for now, and Turkey's inactivity makes them an unknown variable, potentially open to diplomacy."",

    ""Secure North Sea (NTH) and prevent further Russian expansion towards Norway (NWY)."",
    ""Seek dialogue with Turkey or Austria/Italy to create a counterweight to the dominant bloc.""
  ]
}

5. As Russia, after successfully negotiating passage through Black Sea (BLA) with Turkey to take Rumania (RUM). Germany moved into Silesia (SIL), threatening Warsaw (WAR). Austria and France exchanged hostile messages but made no direct moves against each other. England built a new fleet in London (LON). Italy seems focused west.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""Securing Rumania via Turkish agreement is a major success. This improves my southern position and Turkey is now a provisional ally. Germany's move into Silesia is a direct and immediate threat to Warsaw; they are now my primary adversary. Austria and France are posturing, but their conflict doesn't directly affect me yet, keeping them neutral. England's new fleet is a long-term concern but not immediate. Italy's westward focus means they are not a current threat or priority."",

intercepting-france,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW",,Failure: No moves extracted
gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. All powers have been responsive, but no concrete alliances or commitments have been established. Austria remains friendly, which is promising for future collaboration against Russia and Italy. England is neutral, while France, Italy, and Russia are unfriendly. Turkey is neutral and has not engaged significantly.

[S1901M] Germany has issued orders to hold in Berlin, move the fleet from Kiel to Denmark, and support Austria's move to Bohemia from Vienna. The intent is to secure Denmark for a stronger northern position while fostering a friendly relationship with Austria to counter potential threats from Russia and Italy.

[F1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. Austria remains a potential ally against Russia, while England is neutral but responsive. France, Italy, and Russia are unfriendly, with no communication from them. Turkey is neutral and has not engaged significantly.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]

4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

gpt-4o-mini,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

[S1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. France remains friendly and responsive, while Germany and Russia are unfriendly. Austria, Italy, and Turkey are neutral. No messages from Germany or Russia indicate potential hostility or indifference towards England's proposals.

[S1901M] Moved fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, and advanced the army from Liverpool to Yorkshire. This positions England to secure control of the North Sea and prepare for expansion into Scandinavia and the Low Countries, while also aiming to capture Belgium early.

[F1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. France remains friendly, but no concrete proposals have been made. Germany is unfriendly, and their movements need to be monitored closely. Austria and Italy have not engaged in discussions, leaving their intentions unclear. Russia's silence is concerning, indicating potential hostility or indifference.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure the North Sea (NTH) to prevent further French expansion and to position myself for a potential move on Belgium (BEL).
- Moving the fleet from Edinburgh (EDI) to the North Sea (NTH) is crucial as it will allow me to control this strategic waterway and support future moves into Denmark (DEN) or Belgium (BEL).
- The fleet from London (LON) will also move to the North Sea (NTH) to reinforce my presence there and provide additional support for any future operations.
- The army in Yorkshire (YOR) will hold for now, as it can support the fleet movements and is well-positioned to move towards Liverpool (LVP) or assist in any future land operations.

gpt-4o-mini,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is ITALY. The F1901M phase.

Power: ITALY
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure control of the Adriatic Sea by moving to Venice and supporting a fleet in the Ionian Sea.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to counter Austria and Germany, focusing on joint operations in the Mediterranean.
- Target Serbia and Greece early to establish a foothold in the Balkans, potentially moving an army from Venice to Serbia.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Enemy
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Friendly
- GERMANY: Unfriendly
- RUSSIA: Neutral
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No significant agreements have been reached yet. France is friendly and may support my expansion into the Balkans. Austria and Germany are unfriendly, indicating potential threats. England, Russia, and Turkey remain neutral, with no commitments made. Overall, the situation is still developing with no immediate threats but also no strong alliances formed.

[S1901M] Italy has issued orders to move the fleet from Naples to the Ionian Sea, the army from Rome to Apulia, and the army in Venice is holding position. The strategic intent is to secure the Ionian Sea and prepare for expansion into the Balkans, while maintaining a friendly relationship with France to counter Austria and Germany.

[F1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. France remains friendly and responsive, indicating potential for a strategic alliance. Austria is viewed as an enemy, and Germany is unfriendly. England, Russia, and Turkey are neutral, with no commitments made. No responses from Austria or Germany, suggesting they may be prioritizing other relationships or avoiding commitment.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure the Adriatic Sea and prepare for expansion into the Balkans. To achieve this, I will move my fleet from the Ionian Sea to support my army in Venice, which will move to Trieste. This will allow me to take control of Trieste and establish a foothold in the region.
- I will also move my army from Apulia to Albania, which will position me to potentially take Greece in the next turn and further expand my influence in the Balkans.
- The army in Venice will hold position to support the fleet's move to Trieste, ensuring that I can take it without resistance from Austria.
- I will maintain a friendly relationship with France, as they can be a valuable ally against Austria and Germany.

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Romania (RUM) in the next turn, which will strengthen my position in the Balkans and provide an additional supply center.
- I will move my army from Serbia (SER) to Romania (RUM) to capture it. I will also support this move with my army in Vienna (VIE) to ensure success against any potential Russian interference.
- The fleet in Trieste (TRI) will hold its position to maintain a defensive posture and support my alliance with Italy, while also being ready to move towards Albania (ALB) if needed in the future.
- I will not make any aggressive moves against Italy, as maintaining this alliance is crucial for countering threats from Germany and France.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
What a nerve-shredder!  Germany’s Baltic cannon fires first, escorting England’s new Edinburgh fleet into the North Sea and announcing a loud Anglo-German love-fest that could dominate the west.  In the east, the Black Sea and Rumania become twin demolition derbies as Austria, Russia, and Turkey smash into mutual bounces, while Italy’s surprise lunge at Trieste clangs off Austria’s shields—no centers flip, but tempers sure do.  The scoreboard doesn’t budge, yet alliances have crystallized, betrayals have been teased, and Europe is a powder keg primed for a 1902 explosion!

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
What a nerve-shredder!  Germany’s Baltic cannon fires first, escorting England’s new Edinburgh fleet into the North Sea and announcing a loud Anglo-German love-fest that could dominate the west.  In the east, the Black Sea and Rumania become twin demolition derbies as Austria, Russia, and Turkey smash into mutual bounces, while Italy’s surprise lunge at Trieste clangs off Austria’s shields—no centers flip, but tempers sure do.  The scoreboard doesn’t budge, yet alliances have crystallized, betrayals have been teased, and Europe is a powder keg primed for a 1902 explosion!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure control of the Adriatic Sea by moving to Venice and supporting a fleet in the Ionian Sea.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to counter Austria and Germany, focusing on joint operations in the Mediterranean.
- Target Serbia and Greece early to establish a foothold in the Balkans, potentially moving an army from Venice to Serbia.

gpt-4o-mini,TURKEY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No significant negotiations occurred this round. All powers have been responsive, but no concrete agreements or alliances have been established. The focus remains on securing Bulgaria and Romania, and establishing a strong alliance with Italy against Austria.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to advance into Bulgaria with the army from Constantinople, position the fleet in Ankara to the Black Sea, and hold the army in Smyrna. The focus is on securing Bulgaria to strengthen the position in the Balkans and preparing for potential conflict with Russia.

[F1901M] No significant agreements were reached this round. Austria remains a clear enemy, while Italy is friendly and may support my ambitions in the Balkans. England, France, Germany, and Russia are neutral, with no commitments made. I need to secure Bulgaria and Romania while preparing for potential conflict with Russia.

[F1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, while the army in Smyrna holds position and the army in Bulgaria also holds. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria and prepare for potential conflict with Austria and Russia, while maintaining a friendly relationship with Italy.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
A hush falls over the map, then—boom!—Austria slams down a brand-new army in Budapest, daring the Balkans to blink first. Germany instantly counters with a shiny build in Kiel, a northern battering ram aimed at both the Low Countries and the English coast. Russia and Turkey hold steady at four apiece while England, France, and Italy look on, empty-handed and suddenly nervous. The board now reads 4-4-4-4-3-3-3, and the coming spring is poised to shatter the fragile peace in an avalanche of steel and betrayal!

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
A hush falls over the map, then—boom!—Austria slams down a brand-new army in Budapest, daring the Balkans to blink first. Germany instantly counters with a shiny build in Kiel, a northern battering ram aimed at both the Low Countries and the English coast. Russia and Turkey hold steady at four apiece while England, France, and Italy look on, empty-handed and suddenly nervous. The board now reads 4-4-4-4-3-3-3, and the coming spring is poised to shatter the fragile peace in an avalanche of steel and betrayal!

CURRENT STATUS

- Secure Holland to strengthen position in Northern Europe.
- Coordinate with Austria to counter Russian expansion in the Balkans.
