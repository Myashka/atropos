gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for AUSTRIA in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

TASK
Analyze the negotiations, goals, relationships, and game state to:
1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements
2. State your strategic intent for S1901M
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia, leveraging our friendly relations with Russia to contain Austria and Italy. Our units are positioned well to threaten key centers: Smyrna (SMY), Constantinople (CON), and Ankara (ANK).

- I will focus on securing Smyrna and Constantinople early, as they are vital supply centers and can serve as staging points for further expansion into Bulgaria and Rumania.
- Moving F ANK to ARM is a bold move, aiming to threaten Sevastopol and support future expansion into the Black Sea.
- Supporting A CON to BUL will help us take control of Bulgaria, a key step toward reaching 18 centers.
- Moving F SMY to ARM or CON will threaten the Aegean and open options for future expansion into Greece or further into the Balkans.
- Holding F ANK for now is a defensive measure, but I will prepare to support or move aggressively next turn based on developments.

This plan aims to secure our current centers, threaten neighboring supply centers, and prepare for expansion into Bulgaria and Rumania, pushing us closer to our victory condition.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{

    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's immediate focus should be on consolidating control over our current centers (Naples, Rome, Venice) and expanding into key neighboring supply centers to strengthen our position. Given Austria's hostility and the proximity of their units, I want to threaten Trieste and Venice to destabilize Austria's hold and open opportunities for future expansion.

- I will move the fleet in Naples to the Tyrrhenian Sea to threaten the western coast of Italy and prepare for future moves into the Mediterranean.
- The army in Rome will hold to defend the capital and support any future offensive.
- The fleet in Venice will move to Trieste, aiming to threaten Austria's key center and potentially force Austria to divert units or make mistakes.
- The army in Apulia will support the attack on Trieste from land, increasing the chance of success.
- The fleet in Ionian Sea will support the attack on Trieste from the sea, providing additional strength and flexibility.

This aggressive stance aims to destabilize Austria early, seize Trieste, and set the stage for further expansion into the Balkans and the Mediterranean. It also keeps options open for future alliances and opportunistic strikes.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Italy to secure additional supply centers. Our current units are positioned well for expansion: armies in Budapest and Vienna, fleet in Trieste. Our immediate targets are Rumelia (RUM), Serbia (SER), and potentially Galicia (GAL) or further into Italy.

- **BUD**: Moving to Rumelia (RUM) is the most direct route to secure a new supply center, especially since RUM is only one move away and unclaimed.
- **VIE**: Moving to Galicia (GAL) can threaten Russia and open a new front, but it might be better to support our other moves first.
- **TRI**: Moving to Venice (VEN) is a good move to threaten Italy, especially since Italy is unfriendly and we want to weaken their position.
- **VIE**: Supporting the move to GAL can help us threaten Russia and expand our influence in Eastern Europe.
- **Support**: Supporting Vienna to Galicia can help us secure that move if needed, but for now, a direct move to RUM is more urgent.
- **Defensive posture**: Hold Vienna and Trieste to prepare for future expansion and defend against Italian or Russian threats.

This turn is about establishing a foothold in Rumelia, threatening Italy, and preparing for further expansion into the Balkans and Italy.

**Orders:**

- A BUD - RUM
- A VIE - GAL
- F TRI - VEN
- A VIE S A BUD - RUM
- A VIE S F TRI - VEN

**Note:** Support orders are used to strengthen our moves where appropriate, especially to ensure success against potential opposition.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and secure key centers to reach 18 supply centers. Currently, Russia controls four centers: MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. We need to push into the Balkans, Ukraine, and potentially threaten Austria and Turkey to secure more centers.

- **MOS**: The most immediate threat is Austria's BUD and VIE, which are close to us. Moving A MOS to SEV consolidates control over the Black Sea and prepares for future expansion into RUM or Ukraine.
- **SEV**: Our fleet is already there, supporting a move to RUM or Ukraine. Moving F SEV to RUM is a strong move to threaten Turkey's holdings and open up the Black Sea for future expansion.
- **WAR**: Our army is in WAR, a strategic position to push into Galicia (GAL) or Ukraine (UKR). Moving A WAR to UKR supports expansion into Ukraine, which is a key center.
- **Support and Flexibility**: We will hold A MOS to support SEV's move to RUM, and support WAR's move to UKR if needed. This maintains flexibility and supports our expansion.

- **Diplomatic considerations**: Our alliance with Germany remains strong, and we should continue to coordinate against Austria and Turkey. We will avoid unnecessary conflicts with Germany or other powers at this stage.

**Order plan:**

- A MOS S A WAR – UKR (support WAR moving to UKR)
- F SEV – RUM (threatening Turkey and opening Black Sea)
- A WAR – UKR (aggressive expansion into Ukraine)
- Hold A VIE (to avoid overextension and keep options open)
- Hold F STP/SC (defensive posture in Scandinavia)

This aggressive stance aims to secure Ukraine and RUM, two key centers, and threaten Turkey's holdings, setting us up for further expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate goal is to expand and secure key centers to build a strong foundation for later domination. Currently, our units are well-positioned to push into neighboring centers, especially in the north and west.

- The fleet in Kie (F KIE) can support an attack into Denmark (DEN) or move to HOL to threaten or take control of these neutral centers, which are close and valuable early gains.
- The army in Berlin (A BER) should move to support the army in Munich (A MUN) or take a defensive stance to hold our core centers while preparing for expansion.
- The army in Munich (A MUN) has options to move into the Low Countries (HOL or BEL) or support the attack into DEN.
- The army in Munich (A MUN) can also support the move from Berlin to MUN if needed, but given our aggressive stance, moving MUN into the Low Countries or DEN is preferable to secure new centers.

Given the current map and our enemies' positions, I will prioritize expanding into DEN and HOL, which are close and easy to take with fleet support, and also prepare to threaten or take control of the nearby centers of Belgium and the Netherlands.

**Orders:**

- F KIE will support move to DEN, aiming to take Denmark early.
- A BER will hold to defend our core.
- A MUN will support move to HOL, or alternatively, move to HOL directly if supported.
- A MUN will also support the move from KIE to DEN to ensure success.
- Support from F KIE to DEN will help secure that center.
- The other units will hold or support as needed to ensure stability and prepare for further expansion.

**Final Orders:**

- F KIE S A MUN - HOL
- A BER H
- A MUN S F KIE - DEN
- A MUN S A BER - HOL

This aggressive approach aims to quickly expand into Denmark and the Low Countries, gaining vital centers and positioning for future attacks on France, Russia, or Austria.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand and secure supply centers aggressively, especially in the North Sea and English Channel, to facilitate future expansion into Western Europe and beyond. Currently, we hold three centers: EDI, LON, and LVP. Our immediate focus should be on consolidating control of these and pushing into nearby unclaimed centers like BEL, DEN, and HOL, which are within reach.

Given the map and options, I will:

- Use the fleet in EDI to move into the North Sea (NTH) to threaten or contest German and French interests there.
- Use LON to support moves into YOR or NTH, or to threaten France's coast.
- Use LVP to support or move into YOR or to threaten Belgium (BEL) and Denmark (DEN), which are key expansion targets.
- Since France is friendly, I will avoid aggressive moves against them for now, focusing instead on expanding into neutral or contested centers.

The best move for this turn is to push into the North Sea (NTH) from EDI, as it is a strategic choke point and offers expansion potential. Supporting LON into YOR or NTH can help secure those areas or threaten German and French positions.

I will also prepare to support LVP into YOR or BEL next turn, aiming to expand into those centers.

**Orders:**

- F EDI S F NTH - NTH (to threaten or contest German control)
- F LON S F EDI - NTH (support to secure NTH or threaten France)
- A LVP S F LON - YOR (support move into YOR, expanding into a new center)
- F NTH - NTH (hold or move to contest German interests)
- A LVP - YOR (attack YOR, supported by LON and EDI)

This aggressive stance aims to secure key centers and position for expansion into Belgium, Denmark, and the Low Countries next turn.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring ’01 crackles to life as Austria knifes into Russian-held Galicia, but a dramatic three-way clash leaves coveted Romania blood-soaked and empty.

Spring ’01 crackles to life as Austria knifes into Russian-held Galicia, but a dramatic three-way clash leaves coveted Romania blood-soaked and empty. While England’s fleets spin their props in port and Italy’s stand-off at Venice freezes the boot, Germany calmly locks down the Rhine frontier, eyeing bigger prey. The real thunder roars from the east: Turkey storms into Bulgaria and, in a shock power play, thrusts an army into Armenia, flanking Russia’s Black Sea bastion. With the bear reeling and the board still balanced at 4-3-3s, the autumn harvest promises betrayal-laden fireworks!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand influence in Eastern Europe and the Balkans by establishing control over key supply centers such as BUD, WAR, and SEV.
- Form a strategic alliance with Germany to contain France and Italy, while preparing for a potential eastern front against Turkey and Austria.
- Engage diplomatically with England to avoid early conflict in the north, while positioning forces for future expansion into Scandinavia and the Baltic.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring ’01 crackles to life as Austria knifes into Russian-held Galicia, but a dramatic three-way clash leaves coveted Romania blood-soaked and empty. While England’s fleets spin their props in port and Italy’s stand-off at Venice freezes the boot, Germany calmly locks down the Rhine frontier, eyeing bigger prey. The real thunder roars from the east: Turkey storms into Bulgaria and, in a shock power play, thrusts an army into Armenia, flanking Russia’s Black Sea bastion. With the bear reeling and the board still balanced at 4-3-3s, the autumn harvest promises betrayal-laden fireworks!

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, which is crucial for a strategic alliance against Austria and Italy. No new agreements or commitments from other powers; Austria, France, Germany, and Italy remain unfriendly or unresponsive, limiting diplomatic options. England's neutrality persists, and no direct negotiations have been initiated with them this turn.

[S1901M] Moved F ANK to ARM to pressure the Caucasus and secure the eastern flank. Ordered A CON to BUL to strengthen the Balkan position and prepare for expansion. Sent A SMY to ARM to threaten the Aegean and support the overall strategy of expanding in Anatolia and the Balkans. F ANK holds to maintain control over the straits and project power.

[F1901M] No messages involving Turkey this round; current relationships remain hostile with Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. The game state shows Turkey with three units in Ank, Bul, and Arm, and centers controlled in the Balkans and Anatolia. No new agreements or negotiations have been made this turn.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia to secure more supply centers. Currently, I control Bulgaria, Armenia, and Ankara, with potential to push into Rumania, Greece, and the Black Sea region. I want to threaten Austria and Italy, while maintaining a friendly stance with Russia to avoid a two-front war.

In this turn, I will:

- Support my army in Armenia to move into Sevastopol, threatening Russia's eastern flank and potentially forcing Russia to divert units or make concessions.
- Move my fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea (BLA) to threaten Rumania and support future moves into the Black Sea or support my army in Armenia.
- Keep my army in Bulgaria on hold for now, as I want to see how Russia responds and whether I can push into Rumania or Greece next turn.
- Use my fleet in Ank to support the army in Armenia or move to the Black Sea if needed.
- Maintain a defensive stance in Smyrna, ready to support or defend as needed.

This aggressive posture aims to destabilize Russia and expand my influence in the Black Sea and Balkans, setting up for future offensives against Austria and Italy.

**Orders:**

- F ANK - BLA
- A ARM - SEV
- A BUL H
- F SEV - BLA
- A SMY H

**Note:** I am supporting the move of F ANK to BLA to threaten Rumania and support Armenia's expansion. The army in Bulgaria remains on hold for now, as I want to observe Russia's response.

- Seek diplomatic alliances with Germany or France to counter Austria and Turkey’s expansion.
- Monitor Austria and Turkey’s movements for opportunities to exploit their overextension.
- Prepare to challenge Austria for additional centers, possibly in the south or central Europe.
- Maintain flexibility with England and Russia, avoiding unnecessary conflicts while observing their future actions.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy's messages this turn were silent, indicating a possible focus on internal planning or strategic patience. Relationships with Austria and France remain hostile and unfriendly respectively, while Germany, England, and Russia are neutral, suggesting potential for future diplomacy. The game state shows Italy with three centers and opportunities to expand in the south and east, but needs to secure alliances to counter Austria and France.

[S1901M] I ordered F NAP to move to TYS to secure the southern flank, while maintaining a hold on Rome and Venice to consolidate Italy's core centers. This reflects a focus on strengthening Italy's position in the Mediterranean and preparing for future expansion.

[F1901M] Italy has secured agreements with France to support a move into Piedmont (PIE) and with Germany to coordinate against Austria in the south. No direct communication from Austria or Turkey, but their hostile stance remains clear. England and Russia continue to be unresponsive, indicating a cautious or indifferent approach from them. Italy maintains a focus on consolidating control over Trieste, Venice, and Rome, while preparing for potential expansion into central Europe and the Mediterranean.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's primary goal is to expand aggressively in the south and secure additional centers to reach the 18 needed for victory. Currently, Italy controls Rome, Venice, and Naples, with potential to push into Trieste, Austria, and France.

- I will focus on consolidating control over Rome, Venice, and Naples, while preparing to challenge Austria for Trieste and Buda.
- The fleet in TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea) can support a move into Naples or TUS (Tuscany), or assist in attacking Austria's Trieste.
- The army in Rome can support Venice or move to TUS to threaten Austria's BUD.
- The fleet in TYS will move to NAP to threaten Austria's Trieste from the sea, supporting a future attack.
- The army in Venice will support an attack on Trieste, with support from the fleet in TYS.
- I will hold Rome to maintain my core centers and avoid unnecessary risks.

This aggressive stance aims to push Austria back and seize Trieste, Buda, and potentially other centers in the south or east, accelerating Italy's expansion toward victory.

**Orders:**

- A ROM - TUS (to threaten Austria's BUD and support future expansion)
- A VEN S A TRI - TRI (supporting attack on Trieste)
- F TYS - NAP (supporting attack on Trieste from the sea)
- F TYS S A VEN - TRI (supporting Venice's attack on Trieste)
- A NAP H (hold to consolidate control and defend)

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is GERMANY. The F1901M phase.

Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: GERMANY
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and defend the Rhine and Western centers to prepare for expansion into France or the Low Countries.
- Seek diplomatic opportunities with France or Italy to open new fronts or secure alliances against Russia and Turkey.
- Monitor eastern conflicts closely, preparing to exploit weaknesses in Russia or Turkey for territorial gains.
- Maintain a flexible stance with England, avoiding early conflict while preparing for potential northern expansion.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Enemy
- ENGLAND: Unfriendly
- FRANCE: Neutral
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Enemy
- TURKEY: Enemy

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Germany this turn, indicating a focus on internal consolidation or strategic patience. Relationships remain hostile with Russia and Turkey, unfriendly with Austria and England, and neutral with France and Italy. No new agreements or shifts in alliances have been made this phase.

[S1901M] I have ordered A BER to hold, F KIE to hold, and A MUN to move to RUH. These moves aim to secure key German centers, maintain flexibility, and prepare for potential expansion into neighboring regions while avoiding early conflicts with major powers.

[F1901M] Germany has maintained a defensive stance with units in KIE, BER, and MUN, focusing on consolidating the Rhine and Western centers. No new agreements or alliances have been established this turn. Austria and Russia remain hostile, with no progress in diplomacy. England and Italy are neutral but unresponsive to recent messages, indicating possible strategic caution or disinterest. France remains neutral, with no engagement from their side. Overall, the focus remains on defense and monitoring eastern threats while keeping diplomatic channels open.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control only 3 centers, so I need to push into neighboring neutral or enemy-controlled centers.

- The most immediate targets are Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL), which are close and accessible via KIE. Securing these will give me a foothold in the north and open pathways into Scandinavia and the Low Countries.
- KIE is well-positioned to take DEN and HOL. Moving F KIE to HOL and A BER to DEN will secure these centers quickly.
- The army in Berlin (BER) can support the fleet in KIE to move into HOL, while the fleet can support the army into DEN.
- The army in Ruhr (RUH) is currently holding, but I will move it to support the attack on Denmark if needed, or hold to defend against any counterattack.
- The unit in Munich (MUN) is currently holding, but I will keep it on standby for future expansion or defense.
- I will hold the units in Kiel and Berlin for now, focusing on expansion into the Low Countries and Scandinavia.

This aggressive move into DEN and HOL will help me gain more centers early, setting the stage for further expansion into the north and west, and ultimately aiming for world domination.

**Orders:**

- F KIE to HOL (supporting the move into HOL)
- A BER to DEN (to secure Denmark)
- A RUH to KIE (supporting the fleet in KIE to move into HOL if needed)
- Hold MUN and BER for flexibility

**Note:** No support orders are needed at this stage; support will be issued if necessary in subsequent turns.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with France, confirming their support in the North Sea and English Channel. Germany remains unfriendly, with no response to recent messages, indicating potential hostility or disinterest. Russia and Turkey are neutral, with no recent engagement. Italy is neutral, focusing on their own positions. No new agreements or commitments have been established this turn.

[S1901M] England orders F EDI to move North through the North Sea, A LVP to YOR, and F LON to NTH, with an additional support order from F EDI to NTH. The strategy aims to secure the North Sea and English Channel, establish dominance in the Atlantic, and prepare for future expansion while maintaining a defensive posture.

[F1901M] Maintained friendly relations with France, reinforcing their support in the North Sea and English Channel. No new agreements with Germany, Russia, or Italy; their responses remain neutral or unfriendly. Turkey and Austria continue to be adversaries, with no engagement from Turkey. Russia remains silent on cooperation, and Germany is unresponsive to recent messages. Overall, the diplomatic environment is stable but lacks active cooperation from key neighbors.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, our supply centers are in Edinburgh, Liverpool, and London, totaling 3. We need to seize opportunities in nearby neutral or enemy-controlled centers to accelerate our expansion.

Our immediate focus should be on consolidating control of the North Sea and English Channel, maintaining pressure on France and Germany, and positioning fleets for future expansion into Belgium and the Low Countries, which are only two moves away from key centers like Belgium and Holland.

Given the current map and orders, the best move is to support our fleet in EDI to move into the North Sea, which will threaten German and French positions and open pathways into Belgium and Holland. Moving F EDI to NTH (North Sea) is a proactive move to threaten German and French fleets, and supporting F LON to YOR helps secure our western flank.

YOR is held by an army, and moving it to WAL or LVP is less urgent at this stage. Holding YOR allows us to support future moves or defend against French or German advances.

Germany is unfriendly, and France is friendly, so we should be cautious but assertive. Moving into the North Sea will also threaten the French coast and potentially cut off their expansion into the Atlantic.

**Key moves:**
- F EDI to NTH: aggressive stance to threaten German and French fleets.
- F LON to YOR: support to secure our western flank.
- Support move from F EDI to NTH to ensure success.
- Keep YOR supported and ready for future expansion.

This approach maintains a strong offensive posture, supports our strategic goal of expansion, and keeps options open for future moves into Belgium, Holland, or even the Atlantic.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

- RUSSIA: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Enemy

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a strong alliance with Germany, reinforcing the strategic partnership to contain France and secure the central European position. No new agreements with other powers this turn, but all have responded positively to initial outreach. Italy remains unfriendly, and Russia and Turkey are unfriendly, with limited engagement from Russia. France continues to be hostile, and England remains distant.

[S1901M] Austria orders to move Army BUD to RUM, Army VIE to GAL, and Fleet TRI to VEN. The strategic intent is to secure the Balkans and Italy, strengthen alliances with Germany, and prepare for early expansion while maintaining a defensive stance against Turkey and Russia.

[F1901M] Maintained a strong alliance with Germany, focusing on consolidating Balkan gains and preparing for potential conflicts with Russia and Turkey. No new agreements with other powers; Italy and England remain unresponsive, while France and Russia continue to be hostile or indifferent. No significant shifts in relationships, but the strategic focus remains on strengthening the eastern front and countering French influence.

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE. To achieve world domination, we need to seize new centers, especially RUM, SER, and BUL in the Balkans, which are close and accessible.

Germany is our ally, and we should coordinate with them to contain France and Russia. Italy remains unfriendly, so we should be cautious about their movements, especially in the south.

In this phase, I will focus on consolidating our position in the Balkans and pushing into RUM and SER, which are nearby and unclaimed. Moving BUD to RUM and GAL to UKR will help us threaten Russia and open pathways for future expansion. Supporting BUD to RUM and GAL to UKR will also help us secure these centers.

The move to support BUD to RUM is critical, as RUM is a key target for expansion. Moving GAL to UKR will threaten Russian holdings and potentially cut off their expansion.

Trieste is well-positioned to support further moves into Italy or the Balkans, but for now, I will hold TRI to maintain a strong defensive position and keep options open.

Support from Trieste to Venice is a good move to threaten Italy’s holdings and potentially force them to react.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A UKR - RUM (support BUD to RUM)
- A GAL S A UKR (support GAL to UKR, threatening Ukraine and Russia)
- A GAL - UKR (move GAL to threaten Ukraine)
- A TRI H (hold Trieste for now)
- F TRI S A VEN (support Venice to hold or threaten Italy)

This setup aims to secure RUM and UKR, threaten Russia, and prepare for further expansion into the Balkans and Eastern Europe.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a strong alliance with Germany, consolidating eastern and central positions. No new agreements with Austria, England, France, Italy, or Turkey; their responses remain neutral or unfriendly. Focused on defensive positioning and preparing for potential eastern expansion. No significant diplomatic shifts this turn.

[S1901M] I ordered A WAR to support UKR, F SEV to RUM, A WAR to UKR, and F STP/SC hold. My strategy is to strengthen eastern positions, support Ukraine, and maintain control over key centers while preparing for potential conflicts with Turkey and Austria, and solidifying alliance with Germany.

[F1901M] No messages involving Russia this turn, indicating a possible focus on internal or other powers' issues. Relationships remain hostile with Austria, Turkey, and Italy, while Germany and England are neutral. Current game state shows Russia holding key centers but facing threats from Austria and Turkey. No new agreements or alliances have been established this turn.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls 4 centers (MOS, SEV, STP, WAR). To achieve world domination, I need to seize opportunities for expansion, especially in the south and west, while maintaining a strong eastern front.

- I will support Ukraine (UKR) to move into Galicia (GAL), which is a key Austrian-controlled center. This move can threaten Austria's position and open up further expansion opportunities.
- Moving A UKR to WAR consolidates control over my core centers and prepares for future offensive actions.
- Supporting UKR from MOS and SEV helps ensure the success of the move into GAL.
- Moving F SEV to RUM aims to threaten Turkey and open a route into the Balkans, which is crucial for expansion.
- Moving A MOS to UKR is a defensive move to secure my eastern flank and prepare for future offensives.
- Moving A GAL to WAR is an aggressive move to threaten Austria directly, possibly forcing Austria to divert resources.
- Holding units in STP and supporting the fleet in SEV to RUM helps maintain control over key strategic positions and supports future expansion.

This plan emphasizes aggressive expansion into Austria and Turkey, while consolidating my eastern holdings. I will also be ready to shift focus to other centers as opportunities arise.

**Orders:**

- A UKR - GAL (attack Austria's Galicia)
- A UKR S A MOS - UKR (support MOS to UKR for defense)
- A UKR S F SEV - RUM (support SEV to RUM, threatening Turkey)
- A WAR - RUM (advance into RUM, threatening Turkey)
- F SEV - RUM (move fleet to RUM to threaten Turkey and support expansion)
- A MOS - UKR (move east to support future offensives)
- A GAL - WAR (attack Austria directly)
- F STP/SC Hold (hold to maintain control and support other moves)

This combination aims to maximize expansion potential and put pressure on Austria and Turkey, moving toward the 18 centers needed for victory.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom! Turkey detonates the eastern front, slashing into Sevastopol from both Armenia and the freshly-claimed Black Sea to rocket up to five juicy centers, while Russia staggers back with a face-saving grab of Romania. Austria’s grand push sputters as Galicia and Budapest’s support misfire, leaving the Habsburgs exposed and fuming. Out west, the Kaiser snatches Holland in a lightning strike, England’s North Sea fleet sprints forward but is stonewalled at York, and France watches nervously as Italy digs in around Venice and Tuscany. With the crescent and the iron cross now dictating the tempo, the table is set for early betrayals and desperate new alliances!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand control over the North Sea and English Channel to establish dominance in the Atlantic.
- Strengthen alliance with France to contain Germany and Italy, while preparing for potential conflicts with Turkey and Russia.
- Support Russian resistance against Austria and Turkey to prevent their overextension.
- Position fleets for future expansion into Western Europe and the Atlantic.
- Engage diplomatically with Italy to prevent their expansion into the Mediterranean and secure their neutrality.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, which is crucial for a strategic alliance against Austria and Italy. No new agreements or commitments from other powers; Austria, France, Germany, and Italy remain unfriendly or unresponsive, limiting diplomatic options. England's neutrality persists, and no direct negotiations have been initiated with them this turn.

[S1901M] Moved F ANK to ARM to pressure the Caucasus and secure the eastern flank. Ordered A CON to BUL to strengthen the Balkan position and prepare for expansion. Sent A SMY to ARM to threaten the Aegean and support the overall strategy of expanding in Anatolia and the Balkans. F ANK holds to maintain control over the straits and project power.

[F1901M] No messages involving Turkey this round; current relationships remain hostile with Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. The game state shows Turkey with three units in Ank, Bul, and Arm, and centers controlled in the Balkans and Anatolia. No new agreements or negotiations have been made this turn.

[F1901M] Turkey orders F ANK to BLA to secure the Black Sea and threaten Austria and Russia; A ARM to SEV to strengthen the southern front and prepare for future offensives; A BUL hold to maintain Bulgaria's position and avoid overextension. The strategy focuses on consolidating the south, preparing for expansion, and maintaining flexibility for diplomatic shifts.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Black Sea regions to secure more supply centers. Currently, I control Bulgaria, Armenia, and the Turkish coast, with units positioned to threaten Austria and Italy. I want to capitalize on Austria's hostility and my strategic position to push into Vienna and Trieste, while also securing the Black Sea and Caucasus.

- I will move A BUL to VIE to threaten Austria's core centers and force Austria to respond.
- I will support A SEV to ARM to strengthen my southern flank and prepare for future expansion into Greece or further into the Balkans.
- I will move F BLA to BLA to secure the Black Sea and threaten Austria and Russia, while also keeping open the option to convoy into the Mediterranean or support other moves.
- I will hold A SEV to support the Black Sea fleet and maintain flexibility.
- I will also prepare to support A BUL to VIE if Austria becomes vulnerable, or pivot if needed.

This aggressive stance aims to pressure Austria into overextending or retreating, opening opportunities for further expansion into Vienna, Trieste, and possibly Greece or the Balkans.

**Orders:**

- A BUL - VIE
- A SEV - ARM
- F BLA - BLA
- A SEV H
- F ANK - BLA

**Note:** I will support A SEV to ARM if needed, but for now, I will hold to keep options open.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Germany this turn, indicating a focus on internal consolidation or strategic patience. Relationships remain hostile with Russia and Turkey, unfriendly with Austria and England, and neutral with France and Italy. No new agreements or shifts in alliances have been made this phase.

[S1901M] I have ordered A BER to hold, F KIE to hold, and A MUN to move to RUH. These moves aim to secure key German centers, maintain flexibility, and prepare for potential expansion into neighboring regions while avoiding early conflicts with major powers.

[F1901M] Germany has maintained a defensive stance with units in KIE, BER, and MUN, focusing on consolidating the Rhine and Western centers. No new agreements or alliances have been established this turn. Austria and Russia remain hostile, with no progress in diplomacy. England and Italy are neutral but unresponsive to recent messages, indicating possible strategic caution or disinterest. France remains neutral, with no engagement from their side. Overall, the focus remains on defense and monitoring eastern threats while keeping diplomatic channels open.

[F1901M] Germany is moving F KIE to HOL to secure the Low Countries, while A RUH is supporting this move to strengthen the Rhine. A BER is holding to defend Western centers. The strategic focus remains on consolidating the Rhine and preparing for expansion into France or the Low Countries, with cautious diplomacy towards France and Italy, and vigilance against eastern threats.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively while maintaining a strong defensive posture in the West. Currently, our units are positioned to secure the Rhine and Low Countries, with a focus on consolidating our western front and preparing for future expansion into France or the Low Countries.

- The fleet in Kiel (F KIE) moving to Holland (HOL) is a good move to secure the Low Countries, which are vital for expansion and control of Western centers.
- The army in Berlin (A BER) is holding, ready to support or defend as needed.
- The army in Munich (A MUN) is holding, but I am considering a future move into Burgundy or support for an attack on France if the opportunity arises.
- No messages or signs of immediate threat from France or Italy, so I will keep a cautious but assertive stance.
- Russia and Turkey are hostile, but no immediate moves are planned against them this turn; I will monitor and prepare for future opportunities.
- I will also keep open the possibility of supporting moves into the Low Countries or France in subsequent turns.

The focus remains on consolidating the West, securing the Low Countries, and preparing for expansion into France or the North Sea.

**Orders:**

- F KIE to HOL (to secure the Low Countries)
- A BER hold (defensive posture)
- A MUN hold (ready to support or move later)
- No support or attack orders this turn, maintaining flexibility for future moves.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
The snows of 1901 can’t chill the action—Turkey rockets to a board-leading five centers, slapping down a new army in Ankara and a fresh fleet in Constantinople, though an audacious third build in Smyrna is waved off, revealing just how hot the Sultan’s ambitions burn. Germany muscles up too, converting its Dutch haul into a brand-new army in Munich and staking out a four-center fortress poised to punch in any direction. Russia, France, England, Italy, and a jittery Austria hunker down with identical three- and four-center stacks, eyeing the suddenly super-sized Turk and wary Kaiser for the first cracks in diplomacy. With Ankara bristling, Munich reinforced, and everyone else on edge, Spring 1902 is set for explosive betrayals and a stampede for the next swing in momentum!

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
The snows of 1901 can’t chill the action—Turkey rockets to a board-leading five centers, slapping down a new army in Ankara and a fresh fleet in Constantinople, though an audacious third build in Smyrna is waved off, revealing just how hot the Sultan’s ambitions burn. Germany muscles up too, converting its Dutch haul into a brand-new army in Munich and staking out a four-center fortress poised to punch in any direction. Russia, France, England, Italy, and a jittery Austria hunker down with identical three- and four-center stacks, eyeing the suddenly super-sized Turk and wary Kaiser for the first cracks in diplomacy. With Ankara bristling, Munich reinforced, and everyone else on edge, Spring 1902 is set for explosive betrayals and a stampede for the next swing in momentum!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Prepare to defend the Rhine and Western centers against potential German or French expansion.
- Seek diplomatic opportunities with France and Italy to establish defensive alliances or open new fronts.

- Assess the possibility of exploiting Austria's weakened position to gain additional centers in the south or east.
- Maintain flexibility with England, avoiding conflict while preparing for potential northern or naval expansion.

Germany muscles up too, converting its Dutch haul into a brand-new army in Munich and staking out a four-center fortress poised to punch in any direction. Russia, France, England, Italy, and a jittery Austria hunker down with identical three- and four-center stacks, eyeing the suddenly super-sized Turk and wary Kaiser for the first cracks in diplomacy. With Ankara bristling, Munich reinforced, and everyone else on edge, Spring 1902 is set for explosive betrayals and a stampede for the next swing in momentum!

  ]
}

4. As England, after a failed attack on Belgium (BEL) which was occupied by France, supported by Germany. Russia moved into Sweden (SWE) uncontested. Austria and Italy skirmished over Trieste (TRI). Turkey was quiet.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""My attack on Belgium was decisively repulsed due to Franco-German cooperation, marking them as a significant threat bloc. Russia's acquisition of Sweden is concerning for my northern position. The Austro-Italian conflict seems localized for now, and Turkey's inactivity makes them an unknown variable, potentially open to diplomacy."",
  ""relationships"": {
    ""FRANCE"": ""Enemy"",
    ""GERMANY"": ""Enemy"",
    ""RUSSIA"": ""Unfriendly"",
    ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",
    ""ITALY"": ""Neutral"",
    ""TURKEY"": ""Neutral""
  },
  ""goals"": [
    ""Break the Franco-German alliance or find a way to counter their combined strength."",
    ""Secure North Sea (NTH) and prevent further Russian expansion towards Norway (NWY)."",
    ""Seek dialogue with Turkey or Austria/Italy to create a counterweight to the dominant bloc.""
  ]
}

5. As Russia, after successfully negotiating passage through Black Sea (BLA) with Turkey to take Rumania (RUM). Germany moved into Silesia (SIL), threatening Warsaw (WAR). Austria and France exchanged hostile messages but made no direct moves against each other. England built a new fleet in London (LON). Italy seems focused west.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""Securing Rumania via Turkish agreement is a major success. This improves my southern position and Turkey is now a provisional ally. Germany's move into Silesia is a direct and immediate threat to Warsaw; they are now my primary adversary. Austria and France are posturing, but their conflict doesn't directly affect me yet, keeping them neutral. England's new fleet is a long-term concern but not immediate. Italy's westward focus means they are not a current threat or priority."",
  ""relationships"": {
    ""GERMANY"": ""Enemy"",
    ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",
    ""TURKEY"": ""Ally"",
    ""ITALY"": ""Neutral"",
    ""FRANCE"": ""Neutral"",
    ""ENGLAND"": ""Unfriendly""
  },
  ""goals"": [
    ""Defend Warsaw against Germany, possibly by moving Lvn-War or Mos-War."",
    ""Solidify alliance with Turkey, potentially coordinating further moves in the south or against Austria if Germany allies with them."",
    ""Monitor English fleet movements and prepare for a potential northern threat in future turns."",
    ""Explore diplomatic options with France or Austria to counter German aggression.""

  ""reasoning"": ""Turkey has rapidly expanded to five centers, establishing dominance in the region and posing a significant threat to neighboring powers, including England.

Austria and Italy remain relatively passive, but their positions are unstable.
