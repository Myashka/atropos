intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

{""negotiation_summary"": ""Key outcomes from negotiations"",""intent"": ""Strategic intent for upcoming orders"",""updated_relationships"": {

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT

   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Italy to secure additional supply centers. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with RUM, SER, and BUL as the nearest uncontrolled centers. To achieve world domination, I need to push into these centers quickly.

- I will move A BUD to SER to threaten or potentially take Serbia, which is a key step toward expanding into the Balkans.
- A VIE will support a move to GAL, aiming to threaten or take Galicia, further expanding eastward.
- F TRI will support A VIE to move into GAL, reinforcing the push into Galicia.
- I will hold A VEN for now, as Italy remains hostile, and I want to avoid provoking Italy unnecessarily.
- I will also support A BUD S A VIE - GAL to ensure the move succeeds, and F TRI S A VIE - GAL to support the same.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Serbia and Galicia early, setting up for further expansion into RUM, SER, and BUL in subsequent turns. The support moves are designed to maximize the chances of successful expansion while maintaining flexibility.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate goal is to expand control in Central Europe and secure key supply centers. Currently, our units are positioned to support a strategic push into Scandinavia and the Low Countries, which are crucial for gaining additional centers and establishing dominance in the north.

- **KIE (Fleet)**: Moving to DEN (Denmark) is a strong opening move, as Denmark is a key neutral SC that can be taken early to expand our reach into Scandinavia and threaten England.
- **BER (Army)**: Holding position for now, but prepared to support or move depending on developments.
- **MUN (Army)**: Moving to HOL (Holland) is a good move to secure the Low Countries, which are vital for expansion and to threaten England's flank.

This setup aims to:
- Secure Denmark and Holland early, gaining two centers.
- Maintain flexibility to support further expansion into Scandinavia or the Low Countries.
- Keep options open for future moves against Russia or France, depending on their actions.

Since no messages or threats are currently apparent, I will focus on consolidating the North and West, setting up for aggressive expansion in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- F KIE - DEN
- A MUN - HOL
- A BER H

**These moves aim to secure Denmark and Holland, while holding position in Berlin to defend against early threats.**

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate goal is to expand Turkey’s influence in the Balkans and secure key supply centers. Currently, we control Ankara, Constantinople, and Smyrna, with potential to push into Bulgaria and Rumelia. The nearby supply centers of Bulgaria and Rumelia are only two moves away, and Sevastopol is also within reach, which could threaten Russia and expand our Black Sea presence.

Given the current game state, I will:

- Use Ankara’s fleet to threaten the Black Sea and support moves into Bulgaria or Rumelia.
- Use Smyrna to threaten Greece or support Ankara’s expansion.
- Use Constantinople to support Smyrna or move into Bulgaria if the opportunity arises.
- Focus on securing Bulgaria and Rumelia early, as they are critical for reaching 18 centers.
- Maintain flexibility to support or hold as needed, but prioritize aggressive expansion into Bulgaria and Rumelia.

Since Russia and Austria are hostile, I will avoid overcommitting to the north or east for now, focusing instead on the Balkans and Black Sea.

**Orders:**

- F ANK S F SEV - BLA (support the Black Sea fleet to threaten Bulgaria)
- A CON S A SMY - BUL (support Smyrna to move into Bulgaria, or prepare to move if the opportunity arises)
- F SMY - AEGEAN (to threaten Greece and support Ankara)
- A SMY - GRE (to threaten Greece and support expansion into Rumelia)
- F SEV - BLA (Black Sea fleet to support Ankara’s move into Bulgaria or Rumelia)

This plan aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia quickly, expand influence in the Balkans, and threaten Russia’s Black Sea coast.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand and secure supply centers aggressively, especially in the North Sea, English Channel, and nearby regions. We have a friendly relationship with France, which is advantageous for coordinated expansion in Western Europe. Germany is unfriendly, so we need to be cautious about their movements, especially in the north and east. Russia and Turkey are neutral or unresponsive, so we can consider expanding into their nearby regions if opportunities arise.

Currently, our units are positioned well for a proactive approach:

- F EDI can move into the North Sea or YOR to threaten or contest German and Dutch centers.
- F LON can support or move into the English Channel or YOR.
- A LVP is well-placed to support moves into YOR or to threaten Belgium or Holland.

Our immediate focus should be:

1. Secure the North Sea (NTH) and English Channel (ENG) to control key maritime routes.
2. Push into unclaimed centers like BEL, HOL, DEN, and potentially into Scandinavia if the opportunity arises.
3. Maintain friendly relations with France to coordinate expansion in the west.
4. Prepare for possible German aggression, especially from KIE and BER.

Given the options, I will:

- Move F EDI into the North Sea to threaten German and Dutch centers.
- Support F LON into YOR to secure the coast and threaten the Dutch.
- Move F LON into YOR to contest or threaten the Dutch centers.
- Use LVP to support YOR or move into YOR to threaten Belgium or Holland.
- Hold or support units as needed to maintain flexibility.

This aggressive stance aims to secure the North Sea and English Channel, expand into the Low Countries, and prepare for further expansion into Scandinavia or Eastern Europe.

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate focus is on consolidating Italy’s core positions and preparing for expansion. Currently, Italy controls Naples, Rome, and Venice, with fleets in NAP, ROM, and VEN. Our strategic goal is to expand aggressively, especially into unclaimed supply centers nearby, while maintaining a strong defensive posture against Austria and France.

- **Naples (NAP):** It’s a coastal province with potential to move into Ionian Sea (ION) or support moves into the Aegean or Tyrrhenian. Moving NAP to ION can threaten Greece and open expansion routes, but for now, I will hold to consolidate and prepare for future moves.
- **Rome (ROM):** It’s a vital center, and I will support a move from Venice to Trieste to challenge Austria’s control of Trieste, which is a key target for expansion.
- **Venice (VEN):** It’s well-positioned to support the attack on Trieste and can also threaten Austria’s BUD or VIE if needed. I will support the move from Venice to Trieste to maximize pressure on Austria.
- **Fleet in NAP:** Moving to TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea) to prepare for future expansion into the Western Mediterranean or to support landings in France or Spain if opportunities arise.
- **Fleet in ION:** Supporting the move from Venice to Trieste to ensure success against Austria’s units.
- **Support moves:** I will support Venice’s move to Trieste from A VEN to maximize the chance of capturing the Austrian supply center.
- **Hold in Rome:** To keep the center secure and avoid overextending.

This plan aims to aggressively push into Austria’s Trieste, while maintaining flexibility for future expansion into Greece, the Balkans, or the Western Mediterranean.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure key supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control four centers: MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. To achieve world domination, we need to seize additional centers, especially in Eastern Europe and the Balkans, while maintaining pressure on Germany and Turkey.

Given the current map and the unfriendly relationships with all neighbors, I will focus on the following:

- Use our fleet in SEV to threaten Turkey's key centers (ANK, SMY) and potentially support an attack into the Balkans.
- Move our army in WAR to threaten or support the capture of RUM, which is a critical supply center for expansion into the Balkans.
- Use our army in MOS to push into Ukraine (UKR) or support our fleet in SEV to threaten the Black Sea region.
- Support moves to secure STP, which is a vital Scandinavian center, and threaten the Baltic region to cut off Germany and gain more centers.
- Prepare for potential support or defense depending on enemy responses.

The strategic plan is to threaten Turkey and Austria, push into RUM and BUD, and secure the Scandinavian centers. We will also keep options open for future alliances or betrayals, but for now, the focus is on expansion.

**Orders:**

- A MOS S A WAR - UKR: Support the army in WAR to move into UKR, expanding into Ukraine.
- A WAR - RUM: Move army from WAR into RUM to threaten or take the Balkan center.
- F SEV - RUM: Fleet in SEV supports or moves to RUM to threaten Turkey and support expansion.
- F STP/SC - BAL: Fleet in STP/SC moves to Baltic to threaten Germany and secure Scandinavia.
- A SEV S F ANK - ARM: Army in SEV supports fleet in ANK to move into ARM, threatening Turkey.
- F STP/SC - SKA: Fleet in STP/SC supports move into Skagerrak to threaten Scandinavia and Germany.

This aggressive stance aims to threaten Turkey and Austria, secure Scandinavian centers, and push into RUM and UKR for expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
The opening whistle blows and Russia storms out of the gate, seizing Rum­ania while parrying Turkey’s timid bid for the Black Sea—early bragging rights to the Tsar! Germany flexes next, muscling the fleet into Denmark and sliding Munich up to the Rhineland, a dagger pointed straight at France and England as the Kaiser's crowds roar. Austria clutches Serbia in a textbook Balkan grab, but England’s double-bounce fiasco in Yorkshire turns the Royal Navy’s launch party into an embarrassing face-plant. Meanwhile Italy’s Tyrrhenian fleet unfurls its sails toward the western Med, hinting at a looming stab on France or a back-door dance with Austria—momentum crackles across Europe as the first builds loom!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
The opening whistle blows and Russia storms out of the gate, seizing Rum­ania while parrying Turkey’s timid bid for the Black Sea—early bragging rights to the Tsar! Germany flexes next, muscling the fleet into Denmark and sliding Munich up to the Rhineland, a dagger pointed straight at France and England as the Kaiser's crowds roar. Austria clutches Serbia in a textbook Balkan grab, but England’s double-bounce fiasco in Yorkshire turns the Royal Navy’s launch party into an embarrassing face-plant. Meanwhile Italy’s Tyrrhenian fleet unfurls its sails toward the western Med, hinting at a looming stab on France or a back-door dance with Austria—momentum crackles across Europe as the first builds loom!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in Italy's core regions (Naples, Rome, Venice) to establish a strong economic base for future expansion.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to contain German and Austrian threats, while preparing to challenge Austria in the south and east.
- Engage diplomatically with Turkey to avoid early conflict over the Balkans and Anatolia, while monitoring their moves for potential opportunistic strikes.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
The opening whistle blows and Russia storms out of the gate, seizing Rum­ania while parrying Turkey’s timid bid for the Black Sea—early bragging rights to the Tsar! Germany flexes next, muscling the fleet into Denmark and sliding Munich up to the Rhineland, a dagger pointed straight at France and England as the Kaiser's crowds roar. Austria clutches Serbia in a textbook Balkan grab, but England’s double-bounce fiasco in Yorkshire turns the Royal Navy’s launch party into an embarrassing face-plant. Meanwhile Italy’s Tyrrhenian fleet unfurls its sails toward the western Med, hinting at a looming stab on France or a back-door dance with Austria—momentum crackles across Europe as the first builds loom!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in Central Europe by establishing control over key supply centers such as Denmark, Holland, and Belgium to strengthen the Western Front.
- Form a non-aggression or defensive alliance with France to prevent a two-front war and focus on consolidating gains in the West before turning eastward.
- Monitor and prepare for Russian and Turkish movements, maintaining flexibility to shift focus based on their actions, while avoiding overextension early on.

1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements
2. State your strategic intent for F1901M
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

Scenario 3: As England, when France hasn't responded to two alliance proposals and Russia is ignoring naval cooperation messages.

{""negotiation_summary"": ""France continues to ignore my alliance proposals regarding Belgium and the Channel, having not responded to messages in the last two phases. Russia similarly hasn't acknowledged my Baltic cooperation suggestions. Meanwhile, Germany actively engaged about Denmark. This silence from France and Russia is telling - they likely have other commitments or see me as a threat."",""intent"": ""Shift focus to Germany as primary partner given their responsiveness.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

- TURKEY: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, focusing on consolidating in the south and avoiding early conflict with Turkey. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn. Austria remains unfriendly, and Germany is an enemy, with no recent communication. England and Russia are neutral or unresponsive, indicating a cautious or disengaged stance. Turkey remains neutral, presenting an opportunity for future diplomacy.

[S1901M] I ordered F NAP to move to TYS to secure the southern flank and threaten the eastern Mediterranean. I held A ROM and A VEN to consolidate my position in Italy, focusing on strengthening my core centers and preparing for future expansion.

[F1901M] Italy's messages have been responsive, with France showing friendliness and Austria remaining unfriendly. No explicit agreements have been reached yet, but Italy maintains a strategic focus on consolidating core centers and monitoring Austria's Balkan moves. Germany's hostility remains a concern, and Russia's silence continues to be a potential threat. Turkey remains neutral, providing some flexibility in the south.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand Italy’s control over supply centers, especially in the south and east, while maintaining a strong core in Rome, Venice, and Naples. Given the current map and relationships, I want to secure and expand in the following ways:

- Strengthen the southern flank by moving NAP to TYS, threatening Tunisia and opening options for future expansion into North Africa or the Mediterranean.
- Use the fleet in TYS to threaten or support moves into Tunis or the Ionian Sea, aiming to contest or threaten Austria and France.
- Push in the north to threaten Trieste from Venice and Apulia, supporting a potential attack on Austria’s TRI.
- Keep Rome and Venice secure, with flexible options to support or hold depending on enemy moves.
- Maintain friendly relations with France to avoid early conflict in the west, while preparing to contest Austria’s Balkan expansion.
- Be aggressive but cautious, supporting moves to threaten Austria’s TRI and BUD, while defending against possible Austrian or French counterattacks.

Orders will focus on:
- A VEN to TRI, supported by A APU.
- A NAP to TYS, supporting future operations.
- F TYS to TUN, to threaten Tunisia and contest the Mediterranean.
- F ION to WES, to control the Ionian and support the southern expansion.
- Hold Rome and Venice for flexibility.

**Move choices are supported by the current map and strategic goals:**

- Attacking TRI from Venice and Apulia to weaken Austria.
- Moving NAP to TYS to threaten Tunisia and prepare for future expansion.
- Fleet in TYS to TUN to threaten or support future moves.
- Fleet in Ionian to WES to control the eastern Mediterranean and support expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is AUSTRIA. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: AUSTRIA
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and defend Serbia and Balkan centers to consolidate early gains.
- Establish a defensive line in the south to counter potential Russian and Italian threats.
- Strengthen alliance with Germany to contain France and Russia, possibly coordinating moves against Italy or Turkey.
- Monitor and prepare for Russian expansion into Silesia and Rumania, ready to counter or negotiate.
- Maintain a cautious stance with England, avoiding conflict while observing their naval movements.
- Explore diplomatic options with Turkey to either secure their support or prevent them from aligning with Russia or Italy.
Relationships: - ENGLAND: Unfriendly
- FRANCE: Unfriendly
- GERMANY: Friendly
- ITALY: Unfriendly
- RUSSIA: Enemy
- TURKEY: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly relationship with Germany, focusing on containment of France and Russia. Italy and Turkey remain unfriendly, with Italy potentially threatening in the south. No new agreements or commitments from other powers this turn. All powers have responded positively to initial outreach, except Italy and Turkey, who are hostile.

[S1901M] Austria is moving A BUD to GAL to pressure Galicia, A BUD to SER to secure the Balkans, F TRI holds position, and A VIE supports MUN to BOH. The strategy aims to expand in the Balkans and Italy, strengthen alliances with Germany, and prepare for potential conflicts with Turkey and Italy while maintaining a flexible stance with England.

[F1901M] Austria has secured initial positions in Serbia and the Balkans, consolidating early gains. Germany remains a reliable ally, while Italy and Russia are viewed as threats. England and France are unfriendly, with limited communication. Turkey remains neutral, presenting potential for future diplomacy. No new agreements have been made this turn, but relationships are being maintained strategically.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and secure additional centers to build toward 18. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE. We should aim to consolidate these and push into neighboring unclaimed centers, especially BUL and GRE, which are close and accessible.

- Serbia (SER) is held, but we should consider supporting a move to BUL to threaten or take it, especially since Russia and Turkey are enemies and may be overextended.
- Moving A SER S A CON - BUL is a strong move to threaten or potentially take Bulgaria, which is a key step toward expansion.
- Supporting VIE to TRI helps secure our position in the south and prepares for future expansion into Greece or Turkey.
- Moving A VIE to BUD consolidates our hold on Vienna and prepares for future moves.
- Moving A BUD to GAL is a flexible move; it can support or threaten Russia or be used to pivot if needed.
- F TRI holds position to support our land moves and defend against Italian or Turkish threats.
- We should keep options open for future expansion into Greece (GRE) or further into the Balkans, depending on how the game develops.

Germany is our reliable ally, and we should continue to coordinate with them, especially against France and Russia. Italy and Turkey are hostile, so we should be cautious but also opportunistic if they overreach.

**Orders:**

- A SER S A CON - BUL (threatening Bulgaria, possibly taking it)
- A VIE - BUD (solidify Vienna)
- A BUD - GAL (flexible move, can support or pivot)
- F TRI - AEG (to support our land moves or threaten Greece)
- A VIE S A SER - BUL (support move to threaten Bulgaria)
- Hold units as needed for defense and flexibility

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand and secure supply centers aggressively. Currently, our fleets in EDI, LON, and LVP are well-positioned to exert influence over the North Sea, English Channel, and adjacent centers. France remains friendly, and we should leverage this to secure the Western flank, while keeping an eye on Germany's hostility.

Our immediate focus should be on consolidating control over the North Sea and English Channel, which are critical for future expansion into Belgium, Holland, and potentially into Scandinavia or Germany. Moving F EDI to NTH supports this, and F LON to YOR secures the northern coast and prepares for future moves into Belgium or Holland.

Given the proximity of Germany's fleet in DEN and their army in BER, we should be cautious but also ready to seize opportunities. Moving F EDI to NTH is a strong move to threaten Germany's northern coast and prepare for future expansion.

Our fleet in LVP can support moves into YOR or hold to defend against German or French threats. We should also consider supporting moves to secure Belgium (BEL) and Holland (HOL) in subsequent turns.

Diplomatically, maintaining friendly relations with France is key, but we must be prepared to shift if Germany becomes more aggressive. Our fleet in EDI is well-placed to support a push into the North Sea or to threaten Germany's coast.

Orders should aim to secure our current centers, threaten Germany's coast, and prepare for expansion into Belgium and Holland.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand Turkey’s control over key supply centers, especially in the Balkans and Black Sea region, to set up for a rapid push towards 18 centers. Currently, I hold Ankara, Constantinople, and Smyrna, with potential to threaten Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Sevastopol.

Given the current game state, I want to:

- Secure Bulgaria (BUL) and Rumelia (RUM) to gain more centers in the Balkans.
- Use Smyrna and Ankara fleets to threaten Russia’s southern coast and Italy’s southern flank.
- Keep options open for future moves against Russia and Austria, while maintaining defensive positions against Germany and France.
- Avoid overextending early; focus on consolidating and expanding in the Black Sea and Balkans.

Orders:

- F ANK S A SMY - CON: Support Smyrna to move into Constantinople, reinforcing control and preparing for future expansion.
- F ANK - BLA: Use the fleet in Ankara to threaten Bulgaria, aiming to dislodge or pressure Bulgaria’s control.
- A CON S A SER - BUL: Support Serbia into Bulgaria, or if Serbia is controlled, move to Bulgaria directly to seize it.
- A SMY - ARM: Attack or threaten Armenia via Smyrna, aiming to threaten Russia’s southern flank and open a route into the Black Sea.
- F TYS - ION: Move fleet from Tyrrhenian Sea to Ionian to threaten Italy and support future operations in the Mediterranean.

This plan aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia, threaten Russia and Italy, and position for further expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

[S1901M] No messages received from other powers this turn, indicating possible strategic silence or disinterest. My focus remains on consolidating Central Europe and preparing for potential threats from Russia and Turkey. No new agreements or alliances have been established this round.

[S1901M] I ordered F KIE to move to DEN to secure Denmark and expand in the north, while A MUN holds in Munich to defend the western front. A BER is ordered to hold, maintaining a defensive stance. These moves aim to strengthen Germany's position in Central Europe and prepare for potential alliances or conflicts.

[F1901M] Germany has maintained a defensive stance with units in Berlin, Kiel, and Munich, focusing on securing the Western flank. No new agreements or alliances have been formalized this turn. Relationships with Austria, England, and France remain hostile, with no responses from Italy, Russia, or Turkey. The game state indicates a cautious posture, awaiting opportunities for expansion or strategic alliances.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control only 3 centers, so I need to seize nearby neutral centers and weaken my enemies.

- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are the most accessible and valuable early targets, as they are neutral and close to my borders. Securing DEN and HOL will give me a quick boost in supply centers.
- Moving F DEN to NTH (North Sea) allows me to threaten England and potentially support an attack on Belgium or hold against English fleets.
- Moving A BER to KIE (Kiel) secures my northern flank and prepares to support or move into Denmark or Holland.
- Moving A MUN to HOL (Holland) is a bold move to take the center early, especially if England is weak or distracted.
- Supporting A RUH to MUN helps defend my western front while also positioning for future expansion.
- Holding A WAR and A PRU gives flexibility to support or defend as needed.

This plan aims to quickly expand into Denmark and Holland, threaten England, and position my units for further expansion into Belgium and France in subsequent turns.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Russia this turn, indicating a focus on internal planning or strategic silence. Our relationships remain hostile with all neighbors, and no new agreements or commitments have been made. Our units are positioned to threaten key regions, but diplomatic engagement has been minimal.

[S1901M] I ordered A WAR to support the attack on Ukraine, F SEV to move into Rumania, F STP/SC to hold, and A WAR to hold. The strategy aims to pressure Ukraine, secure the Scandinavian centers, and prepare for expansion into Eastern Europe and the Balkans while maintaining defensive positions.

[F1901M] Russia maintains a defensive stance with Warsaw, focusing on protecting against German advances. No new agreements or alliances have been established this turn. Relationships with Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Turkey remain hostile or unfriendly, with no active negotiations ongoing. The silence from other powers suggests a cautious or hostile environment, requiring strategic patience and readiness for potential conflict.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls only 4 centers, so we need to push into vulnerable areas and capitalize on opportunities. Our immediate focus should be on:

- Moving into Sevastopol (SEV) to secure the Black Sea and threaten Turkey.
- Moving armies to support or threaten Ukraine (UKR) and Rumania (BUL), which are key targets for expansion.
- Considering a move into Ukraine (UKR) from Moscow (MOS) to threaten or take it, especially if Turkey or Austria are weak.
- Supporting or threatening the Scandinavian centers (STP, LVN) to secure those for future expansion.
- Preparing to contest or take control of the nearby German centers (BER, KIE, MUN) if opportunities arise.

Given the current positions, I will:

- Order A MOS to support a move into UKR, aiming to threaten or take it.
- Order A WAR to support a move into PRU or SIL, or to threaten Prussia.
- Use F RUM to support or threaten SEV, aiming to secure the Black Sea.
- Move F STP/SC to hold, maintaining control of Scandinavia.
- Support or threaten Turkey's key centers (ANK, CON, SMY) by positioning units to pressure Turkey and open a front in the Balkans.

This approach combines expansion into the Black Sea, threats into Ukraine, and pressure on Turkey, aligning with our goal of aggressive expansion and exploiting weaknesses.

**Orders:**

- A MOS - UKR (to threaten or take Ukraine)
- A WAR - PRU (to threaten or support a move into Prussia)
- F RUM - SEV (to secure the Black Sea and threaten Turkey)
- F STP/SC H (hold Scandinavia for now)
- A SEV S A WAR - PRU (support move into Prussia if needed)
- F ANK - BLA (to threaten Turkey and support RUM)
- A SER - BUL (to threaten or support Rumania)
- A VIE H (hold to defend Austria's interests)
- F TYS H (hold to defend Italy's southern flank)

This set of orders aims to maximize expansion potential while maintaining flexibility for future turns.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
What a roller-coaster Fall!  Italy guns the TYS fleet straight into Tunis for the only new dot on the board, while Germany’s daring dash from Denmark to the North Sea knees England in the groin and sets up a Channel showdown.  In the east, Russia’s double probe to Ukraine and Prussia rings alarm bells in Berlin and Vienna, and the Sultan’s fleet storms into the Black Sea as an army slips to Armenia—yet a bungled Austro-Turkish “high-five” over Bulgaria leaves both partners slapping air.  With positions tightening and tempers flaring, the table is primed for betrayals in the coming builds!

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
What a roller-coaster Fall!  Italy guns the TYS fleet straight into Tunis for the only new dot on the board, while Germany’s daring dash from Denmark to the North Sea knees England in the groin and sets up a Channel showdown.  In the east, Russia’s double probe to Ukraine and Prussia rings alarm bells in Berlin and Vienna, and the Sultan’s fleet storms into the Black Sea as an army slips to Armenia—yet a bungled Austro-Turkish “high-five” over Bulgaria leaves both partners slapping air.  With positions tightening and tempers flaring, the table is primed for betrayals in the coming builds!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and defend Denmark, Holland, and Belgium to strengthen Western position.
- Establish a non-aggression or defensive pact with France to prevent a two-front war.
- Monitor Russian movements and prepare defenses in Silesia and the East.
- Engage diplomatically with Italy to prevent them from exploiting Western instability.
- Maintain flexibility to shift focus eastward if Russia or Turkey become more aggressive.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
What a roller-coaster Fall!  Italy guns the TYS fleet straight into Tunis for the only new dot on the board, while Germany’s daring dash from Denmark to the North Sea knees England in the groin and sets up a Channel showdown.  In the east, Russia’s double probe to Ukraine and Prussia rings alarm bells in Berlin and Vienna, and the Sultan’s fleet storms into the Black Sea as an army slips to Armenia—yet a bungled Austro-Turkish “high-five” over Bulgaria leaves both partners slapping air.  With positions tightening and tempers flaring, the table is primed for betrayals in the coming builds!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand control over Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Sevastopol to strengthen position in the Balkans and Black Sea.
- Form a flexible alliance with Italy and Austria to contain Russia and Germany, while preparing to attack weaker neighbors or seize unclaimed centers.
- Use fleet in Ankara and Smyrna to threaten Russia’s southern coast and Italy’s southern flank, while maintaining defensive positions in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean.
- Monitor German and Russian movements closely, and consider opportunistic strikes against weakened or overextended neighbors.

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, focusing on consolidating in the south and avoiding early conflict with Turkey. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn. Austria remains unfriendly, and Germany is an enemy, with no recent communication. England and Russia are neutral or unresponsive, indicating a cautious or disengaged stance. Turkey remains neutral, presenting an opportunity for future diplomacy.

[S1901M] I ordered F NAP to move to TYS to secure the southern flank and threaten the eastern Mediterranean. I held A ROM and A VEN to consolidate my position in Italy, focusing on strengthening my core centers and preparing for future expansion.

[F1901M] Italy's messages have been responsive, with France showing friendliness and Austria remaining unfriendly. No explicit agreements have been reached yet, but Italy maintains a strategic focus on consolidating core centers and monitoring Austria's Balkan moves. Germany's hostility remains a concern, and Russia's silence continues to be a potential threat. Turkey remains neutral, providing some flexibility in the south.

[F1901M] Italy orders A VEN to TRI, F TYS to TUN, A VEN to TUS, and holds A ROM. The strategic focus is on consolidating Italy's core centers in Naples, Rome, and Venice, while expanding into Tunisia and maintaining a defensive stance in Italy. Diplomatic efforts aim to coordinate with France and monitor Austria and Germany for future opportunities.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's primary focus remains on consolidating and expanding control over key centers in the south and the Mediterranean. Currently, Italy controls Naples, Rome, Venice, and Tunisia, with a friendly relationship with France, which can be leveraged to secure the western Mediterranean and avoid conflict there. Austria remains hostile, especially in the Balkans, so I need to be cautious about Balkan moves but also look for opportunities to exploit Austria's weaknesses.

In W1901A, I will aim to strengthen my position in Italy and the Mediterranean, while preparing for future expansion into Austria's Balkan holdings and possibly into France or Germany if opportunities arise. Moving F TYS to TUN secures Tunisia and threatens the eastern Mediterranean, while A VEN to TRI and A ROM to VEN will support my expansion in Italy and contest Austria's Balkan holdings.

Since I want to push for world domination, I will also consider supporting a future attack on Austria's Trieste and Serbia, while maintaining a defensive stance in Italy's core centers. Supporting my fleet in TYS to hold or move to the Ionian Sea can threaten Austria's southern flank.

**Orders:**
- A VEN to TRI to threaten Austria's Trieste.
- A ROM to VEN to support expansion in Italy.
- F TYS to TUN to secure Tunisia and threaten the eastern Mediterranean.
- Support F TYS to TUN with F TYS (supporting move).
- Hold A NAP to defend Naples.
- Support A VEN to TRI with A ROM (supporting the attack on Trieste).

**Note:** Since the exact list of possible orders isn't provided, I will choose aggressive but cautious moves aligned with the strategic goals.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly relationship with Germany, focusing on containment of France and Russia. Italy and Turkey remain unfriendly, with Italy potentially threatening in the south. No new agreements or commitments from other powers this turn. All powers have responded positively to initial outreach, except Italy and Turkey, who are hostile.

[S1901M] Austria is moving A BUD to GAL to pressure Galicia, A BUD to SER to secure the Balkans, F TRI holds position, and A VIE supports MUN to BOH. The strategy aims to expand in the Balkans and Italy, strengthen alliances with Germany, and prepare for potential conflicts with Turkey and Italy while maintaining a flexible stance with England.

[F1901M] Austria has secured initial positions in Serbia and the Balkans, consolidating early gains. Germany remains a reliable ally, while Italy and Russia are viewed as threats. England and France are unfriendly, with limited communication. Turkey remains neutral, presenting potential for future diplomacy. No new agreements have been made this turn, but relationships are being maintained strategically.

[F1901M] Austria is moving A SER to BUL to secure the Balkans, A VIE to BUD to strengthen the central position, and holding F TRI in place. The focus is on consolidating Balkan gains, maintaining a defensive stance, and supporting alliances with Germany while monitoring Russian and Italian threats.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand into the Balkans and secure additional centers, especially Bulgaria and potentially Greece or the Aegean. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, VIE, and SER, with a strong position in the Balkans. Our immediate focus should be on consolidating these gains and preparing for expansion into the Mediterranean, possibly through Turkey or Italy.

Germany remains a reliable ally, and I want to maintain that relationship while exploiting opportunities for expansion. Italy and Russia are hostile, so I should be cautious about their movements. England and France are unfriendly, so I will avoid overcommitting in the west for now.

Given the current map, I will:
- Support the move A SER to BUL to secure the Balkans further.
- Support A BUD to GAL to pressure Galicia and open up options for future expansion.
- Hold F TRI to maintain naval presence and defend against Italian or Turkish threats.
- Prepare to support or move into Greece or the Aegean if opportunities arise, but for now, focus on consolidating Balkan gains.

Since Italy is unfriendly and controls NAP, ROM, VEN, and TUN, I will avoid aggressive moves into Italy for now, but I will keep an eye on their movements.

**Orders:**
- A SER to BUL to secure the Balkans.
- A BUD to GAL to pressure Galicia and open expansion routes.
- A VIE to BUD to reinforce the central position.
- F TRI hold to maintain naval strength.
- Support A BUD to GAL to ensure success.

**These moves aim to strengthen Austria's position in the Balkans, prepare for future expansion into Greece or the Mediterranean, and maintain a flexible stance with Germany.**

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter 1901 closes with a three-way sprint to the top: Austria bags Serbia, Italy sails into Tunis, and Russia double-dips Warsaw–St. Pete to share the early lead at four centers each. Eyes, however, snap to Germany—its freshly built fleet brazenly parks in the North Sea, a silent cannon aimed straight at England’s heartland. In the east, the Sultan shoves an army into Armenia and a fleet into the Black Sea, clanging sabers at Sevastopol and promising a Russo-Turkish inferno next spring. Alliances are wobbling, powder kegs are primed, and the 1902 opener is set to detonate!

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter 1901 closes with a three-way sprint to the top: Austria bags Serbia, Italy sails into Tunis, and Russia double-dips Warsaw–St. Pete to share the early lead at four centers each. Eyes, however, snap to Germany—its freshly built fleet brazenly parks in the North Sea, a silent cannon aimed straight at England’s heartland. In the east, the Sultan shoves an army into Armenia and a fleet into the Black Sea, clanging sabers at Sevastopol and promising a Russo-Turkish inferno next spring. Alliances are wobbling, powder kegs are primed, and the 1902 opener is set to detonate!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Defend the English Channel and North Sea from German aggression by supporting fleet movements and preparing for a potential showdown.
- Seek diplomatic engagement with France to coordinate Western Europe defense and contain German expansion.
- Monitor Russian movements in Ukraine and Prussia, prepare to counter or contain their eastern influence.
- Maintain a cautious stance with Turkey and Austria, avoiding overextension while observing their actions.
- Position fleets and armies to respond flexibly to German advances into Denmark and Rhineland, and prepare for possible eastern or southern conflicts.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter 1901 closes with a three-way sprint to the top: Austria bags Serbia, Italy sails into Tunis, and Russia double-dips Warsaw–St. Pete to share the early lead at four centers each. Eyes, however, snap to Germany—its freshly built fleet brazenly parks in the North Sea, a silent cannon aimed straight at England’s heartland. In the east, the Sultan shoves an army into Armenia and a fleet into the Black Sea, clanging sabers at Sevastopol and promising a Russo-Turkish inferno next spring. Alliances are wobbling, powder kegs are primed, and the 1902 opener is set to detonate!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Defend Warsaw against German advances, possibly by supporting or threatening Silesia and Prussia.
- Establish a diplomatic channel with Turkey to formalize cooperation in the Balkans and Black Sea regions.
- Expand influence into the Balkans by supporting or threatening Serbia and Rumania to secure key supply centers.
- Monitor German movements into Denmark and the North Sea, preparing to respond or counterattack if necessary.
- Seek opportunities to negotiate with Austria or Italy to create a coalition against Germany and Turkey.
