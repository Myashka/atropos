intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the North Sea and English Channel, leveraging our friendly relations with France to contain Germany and secure key supply centers. We should aim to secure the Low Countries (Belgium, Netherlands, and Belgium) early, as they are critical for expansion and controlling access to the continent.

Given the current map and options:

- I will move F EDI to NTH to threaten or potentially dislodge German units, while supporting F LON to YOR to secure the western flank.
- F LON will move to YOR, supporting the move from EDI if needed, and also threaten the North Sea.
- A LVP will move to EDI to secure the eastern flank and prepare for future expansion into the Low Countries.
- F BRE remains stationary for now, maintaining friendly relations with France and avoiding unnecessary conflict.
- I will hold units in LON and LVP to observe and support future moves.

This approach aims to establish dominance in the North Sea and English Channel, while positioning for expansion into Belgium and the Low Countries in subsequent turns. It also keeps options open for supporting or supporting-supported moves to maximize flexibility.

**Orders:**

- F EDI S F NTH
- F LON - YOR
- A LVP - EDI
- F BRE H

**Note:** No support orders are necessary at this stage, as the focus is on positioning and threat projection.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand in the Balkans and Italy, while maintaining a defensive stance against Turkey, Germany, England, and France. Given the current map, I see opportunities to push into Serbia and Rumania, which are key to gaining additional centers.

- I will move A BUD to SER to threaten or potentially take control of Serbia, which is a nearby unclaimed supply center.
- I will support A VIE to TRI to prepare for expansion into Trieste, which is a valuable center and currently controlled by Italy.
- I will move F TRI to VEN to threaten Italy's supply center and open a path for future expansion into Italy.
- I will hold A VIE to TRI to support the attack on Venice, aiming to weaken Italy's position.
- I will support A BUD to SER to ensure the move succeeds or to threaten Serbia if Italy or Russia tries to contest.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Serbia and threaten Italy's supply centers, while consolidating Austria's position in the Balkans and Italy. The moves are supported by the fleet in Trieste, which can support the army in Vienna, and the army in Vienna can support the move into Serbia if needed.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A VIE - TRI
- A VIE S A TRI - VEN
- F TRI - VEN
- A BUD - SER
- A VIE - TRI

**Note:** The move A VIE - TRI is a support move for the attack on Venice, and the move A BUD - SER is an aggressive move into Serbia. The fleet in Trieste supports the attack on Venice, and the army in Vienna supports the move into Trieste.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate goal is to expand and secure key supply centers to build a strong foundation for eventual domination. Given the current map and relationships, I will focus on consolidating control over our core German centers (Berlin, Kiel, Munich) and pushing into Scandinavia and the Low Countries to gain early supply centers.

- I will move the Army in Berlin to support the Army in Munich, aiming to secure Munich and prepare for future expansion eastward.
- The Army in Munich will move to Silesia, aiming to threaten or take the nearby centers, while supporting the move from Berlin.
- The Fleet in Kiel will move to Denmark to threaten or take Denmark, a valuable early supply center.
- The Fleet in Kie will move to the North Sea, supporting the Kiel move and positioning for future expansion into the North Atlantic or Scandinavia.
- I will hold the Army in Hamburg (not currently present but assuming a typical initial setup) or prepare to support the fleet moves.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Denmark and push into Scandinavia, while also maintaining a strong position in the west. The support moves from Kiel and Kie will help secure these critical early gains.

**Orders:**

- The Army in Berlin will support the Army in Munich to move to Silesia.
- The Army in Munich will move to Silesia.
- The Fleet in Kiel will move to Denmark.
- The Fleet in Kie will move to the North Sea.
- The Army in Hamburg (if present) will hold or support as needed (not explicitly listed, but assuming a typical initial setup).

**Final Orders:**

- A BER S A MUN - SILE
- A MUN - SILE
- F KIE - DEN
- F KIE - NTH
- (Hold or support in Hamburg if applicable)

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia, leveraging our friendly relations with Russia to secure eastern and southeastern centers. Currently, we hold Ankara, Constantinople, and Smyrna, with nearby unclaimed centers like Bulgaria (BUL), Rumelia (RUM), and Sevastopol (SEV).

Given the map and options, I will focus on consolidating control over our current territories and pushing for Bulgaria and Rumelia, which are only two moves away. Securing Bulgaria (BUL) is critical because it is a key supply center and a stepping stone for further expansion into the Balkans and towards Austria.

- I will move F ANK to BLA to threaten Bulgaria and RUM, aiming to cut off their support and prepare for a future move into Bulgaria.
- I will support A SMY to ARM to strengthen our position in the east and prepare for a potential move into RUM or SEV.
- I will move A CON to BUL to attempt to seize Bulgaria, which is only one step away, and support it with F ANK to BLA to ensure success.
- I will hold A SMY to maintain pressure and support the overall expansion.
- I will keep F SEV stationary for now, as it is a strong position to support our eastern expansion and threaten Russia’s Sevastopol.

This plan aims to quickly secure Bulgaria, expand into Rumelia, and maintain pressure on Russia and Austria, setting up for further expansion in subsequent turns.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls four centers: MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. To achieve world domination, we need to seize nearby uncontrolled centers and threaten our neighbors, especially Austria, Turkey, and potentially Germany.

- **Focus on the East:**
  - Moving A MOS to WAR consolidates control over our current position and prepares for future expansion into Ukraine or the Balkans.
  - Moving A WAR to UKR or LVN could threaten Austria or Poland, but given Austria's hostility and our alliance with Germany, it's better to secure our eastern flank first.

- **Black Sea and Sevastopol:**
  - F SEV should support the move to BLA (Black Sea) or ARM (Ankara).
  - Since Turkey is unfriendly, we should aim to threaten their holdings, but avoid overextending into Turkey directly this turn.

- **Black Sea and Nearby Centers:**
  - F SEV can support a move to ARM or BLA, but ARM is more strategic for future expansion into the Balkans.
  - F SEV S F ANK - ARM is a good move to threaten Turkey's holdings.

- **Supporting and Defensive Moves:**
  - Keep units supported to maintain flexibility and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
  - Holding units in Sevastopol and Moscow for now, while positioning for expansion.

- **Diplomatic considerations:**
  - Maintain alliance with Germany, avoid provoking Austria or Turkey prematurely.
  - Prepare to pivot east or west depending on how the game develops.

**Order plan:**

- A MOS - WAR: Secure our current position and prepare for future expansion.
- A WAR - UKR: Threaten Ukraine, a key buffer and potential expansion target.
- A SEV - BLA: Support move to threaten Turkey's Black Sea holdings.
- F SEV S F ANK - ARM: Support move to threaten Turkey, pressuring them.
- F SEV - BLA: Alternatively, move to BLA to threaten Turkey's coast directly.

This setup keeps options open for future expansion into Ukraine, the Balkans, or further east, while maintaining a strong position in the Black Sea.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate focus is on consolidating control over Italy’s key centers—Naples, Rome, and Venice—while positioning for expansion into nearby supply centers and challenging Austria. Austria is unfriendly, and their units threaten Trieste and Vienna, so we need to prepare to contest or threaten those areas. France remains neutral but is a potential threat from the west, so we should be cautious but also look for opportunities to expand into the Mediterranean.

Currently, our units are:
- F NAP
- A ROM
- A VEN

Our options:
- NAP can support or move to Ionian or Tyrrhenian.
- ROM can move to Naples or support Venice.
- VEN can move to TUS, PIE, TRI, or support other units.

Given the positions:
- Moving F NAP to Ionian (ION) can threaten Austria’s TRI and BUD, and potentially open a route into the eastern Mediterranean.
- Moving A ROM to Naples (NAP) is a strong move to secure the south and threaten Austria’s BUD.
- Moving A VEN to TUS or PIE could threaten Austria’s VIE or TRI, but a more aggressive approach is to support an attack on TRI from Venice and Ionian.

I will:
- Attack Trieste (TRI) with VEN supported by NAP and ION, aiming to take it from Austria.
- Move NAP to ION to support the attack and threaten Austria’s BUD.
- Hold ROM to defend Rome.
- Keep NAP support for the attack on TRI, and support VEN’s move to TRI.

This aggressive stance aims to weaken Austria early, gain Trieste, and prepare for further expansion into Austria’s centers.

**Orders:**
- A VEN S A ROM - TRI (supporting Venice’s move to Trieste)
- A APU S F ION - TRI (supporting fleet move to TRI)
- F ION - TYS (to threaten Austria’s southern flank and support the attack)
- A ROM - NAP (to threaten Austria’s BUD and secure the south)
- F NAP - ION (to support the attack on TRI and threaten Austria’s BUD)

This plan aims to take Trieste, threaten Austria’s BUD, and position for further expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with Austria storming into Serbia but smashing head-first into an Italian wall at Trieste, lighting the Alpine fuse. Germany pulls the double play—hoisting the flag over Denmark while thrusting Munich’s army into Bohemia—now staring down both Vienna and Warsaw as England’s home-field shuffle fizzles. In the east, a vicious Black Sea bounce nukes any Russo-Turkish honeymoon, yet the Sultan still slips into Bulgaria while the Tsar masses in Ukraine. Italy’s fleet surges into the Ionian and France sits poised, but with three fresh neutrals already seized the board crackles for a back-stab bonanza this Fall!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with Austria storming into Serbia but smashing head-first into an Italian wall at Trieste, lighting the Alpine fuse. Germany pulls the double play—hoisting the flag over Denmark while thrusting Munich’s army into Bohemia—now staring down both Vienna and Warsaw as England’s home-field shuffle fizzles. In the east, a vicious Black Sea bounce nukes any Russo-Turkish honeymoon, yet the Sultan still slips into Bulgaria while the Tsar masses in Ukraine. Italy’s fleet surges into the Ionian and France sits poised, but with three fresh neutrals already seized the board crackles for a back-stab bonanza this Fall!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in the Balkans and Anatolia by establishing control over key supply centers such as Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Constantinople, while maintaining a strong defensive posture against neighbors.
- Form a strategic alliance with Russia to counter Austria and Italy, focusing on mutual support and coordinated expansion in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.
- Exploit the potential for a quick strike against Austria or Italy early on, leveraging Turkey's position to seize nearby supply centers and build a foundation for further expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with Austria storming into Serbia but smashing head-first into an Italian wall at Trieste, lighting the Alpine fuse. Germany pulls the double play—hoisting the flag over Denmark while thrusting Munich’s army into Bohemia—now staring down both Vienna and Warsaw as England’s home-field shuffle fizzles. In the east, a vicious Black Sea bounce nukes any Russo-Turkish honeymoon, yet the Sultan still slips into Bulgaria while the Tsar masses in Ukraine. Italy’s fleet surges into the Ionian and France sits poised, but with three fresh neutrals already seized the board crackles for a back-stab bonanza this Fall!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in the Balkans and Italy to gain early supply centers.
- Establish a defensive stance against Turkey and Germany while exploring opportunities for strategic alliances.
- Leverage Austria's central position to facilitate flexible support moves and prepare for potential expansion into Central Europe and the Balkans.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'

    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control three centers: EDI, LON, and LVP. Our immediate focus should be on consolidating control of the North Sea and English Channel, while also pushing into the Low Countries and Belgium to gain more centers.

- Our fleet in EDI is well-positioned to threaten the North Sea and support moves into Belgium or Holland.
- Our fleet in YOR can support EDI or move into the North Sea to contest German control.
- Our army in LVP can support EDI or YOR, or move to YOR to threaten the Dutch or Belgian centers.
- We should aim to take Belgium (BEL) and Holland (HOL) early, as they are only two moves away and are key to expanding into the continent.
- Since France is friendly, we can coordinate with them to avoid conflict in the west and focus on German expansion.
- Germany is hostile, so we should be prepared to contest their moves and possibly threaten their centers if opportunities arise.
- Our orders will focus on securing the North Sea, moving into Belgium and Holland, and supporting each other to maximize expansion potential.

**Move plan:**

- F EDI to NTH to threaten North Sea and support future moves.
- F YOR to NTH to support EDI or contest German fleet.
- A LVP to YOR to threaten the Dutch and Belgian centers.
- Support moves between our fleets to strengthen positions.
- No support or hold orders are necessary at this stage; focus on expansion.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia, while maintaining a strong defensive posture against Austria, Italy, and Germany. Russia remains friendly, so we can coordinate with them to secure the eastern front.

In this initial move, I will focus on consolidating control over Bulgaria and Rumelia, and positioning to threaten or support future offensives into Greece and the Aegean. Moving F ANK to BLA secures the Aegean and prepares for expansion into Bulgaria or supporting Russian moves. Supporting A SMY to ARM helps reinforce our position in Anatolia and potentially threaten Greece or support Russian advances.

Moving A BUL to SER is an aggressive move to threaten Serbia, which is a key target for expansion and can open up the Balkans for further expansion. Supporting A SER from BUL can help secure that move if needed.

Holding A SMY and F ANK allows flexibility for future turns, either supporting or attacking as the situation develops.

This approach aims to secure Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Constantinople, while positioning for expansion into Greece and the Balkans, and maintaining a defensive stance against Austria and Italy.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary focus is expansion in the Balkans and consolidating control over Serbia and Bulgaria, while maintaining a defensive stance against Germany and Turkey. Our units are positioned to support this, with armies in Vienna, Trieste, and Serbia, and a fleet in Trieste.

Given the current map and threats, I will:

- Support Serbia to hold or potentially move into Bulgaria, as Turkey controls Bulgaria and might threaten Serbia.
- Use Vienna to support or threaten Buda, aiming to secure or threaten Budapest.
- Use Trieste to support or move into Venice or support Italy's units if needed, but primarily to prepare for expansion into the Balkans.
- Consider a bold move into Bulgaria from Serbia to threaten Turkey's position, or support Serbia to hold Bulgaria if Turkey pushes.

Since Turkey is an enemy and controls Bulgaria, I will focus on supporting Serbia to hold Bulgaria, while preparing to expand into Serbia or Buda if opportunities arise. I will also support Vienna to Buda to threaten or secure that position.

**Orders:**

- A SER S A BUD - BUD (support Serbia to move into Buda if needed)
- A VIE - TRI (move Vienna to Trieste to threaten Italy or support Trieste)
- F TRI - VEN (move fleet to support or threaten Italy's units)
- A BUD - SER (advance into Serbia to threaten Turkey and gain control)
- Support A SER S A BUD - BUD (support Serbia to Buda to secure the position)

This plan aims to strengthen our Balkan position, threaten Turkey, and prepare for expansion into Serbia and Bulgaria, while maintaining defensive support in Vienna and Trieste.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is RUSSIA. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: RUSSIA
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Defend Warsaw against German advances, possibly by moving armies to support or reinforce.
- Solidify alliance with Turkey to secure the Balkans and prepare for future expansion.
- Engage diplomatically with France and Austria to explore opportunities for countering the German-Austrian bloc.
- Monitor and prepare for potential threats from Italy and England in subsequent turns.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Enemy
- GERMANY: Enemy
- ITALY: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, reinforcing the alliance and coordinating on eastern expansion. No new messages from Austria, England, Italy, or Turkey, indicating possible disengagement or strategic silence. No formal agreements reached this turn, but the groundwork for cooperation with Germany is solid. Russia's diplomatic activity remains consistent with previous efforts.

[S1901M] Russia is moving armies to war and Ukraine to secure eastern positions, while supporting Sevastopol with fleet movements to maintain Black Sea influence. The fleet in Sevastopol is convoying to Armenia, aiming to strengthen southern holdings. St. Petersburg convoy is holding, preparing for future flexibility. The strategy focuses on consolidating eastern centers, maintaining a defensive stance, and preparing for potential expansion eastward.

[F1901M] Maintained communication with Turkey, but no new agreements were reached. Germany and Austria remain hostile, with ongoing tensions in the east and south. France and England have not responded to recent messages, indicating possible disengagement or strategic silence. The game state shows Russia with a solid position in the east but facing threats from Germany and Austria, while the west remains uncertain due to lack of diplomatic clarity.

Russia's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls 4 centers (MOS, SEV, STP, WAR). To achieve world domination, I need to push eastward and also consider opportunistic moves in the south and potentially in the west.

In the Black Sea, Sevastopol is well-positioned to threaten Turkey and support further expansion into the Balkans or the Caucasus. Moving F SEV to ARM or BLA can threaten Turkey's holdings and open new avenues for expansion.

Ukraine (UKR) is a key staging ground. Moving A UKR to RUM or GAL can threaten Romania or Austria, respectively. RUM is a critical target, as it is only one move away from being controlled, and it is a strategic step toward gaining more centers in the Balkans and the south.

Warsaw (WAR) is a vulnerable border with Germany. Moving A WAR to GAL or supporting other moves can help secure the eastern flank and prepare for future expansion into the west or south.

Given the current map and the need for expansion, I will:

- Support the move of F SEV to ARM to threaten Turkey and open a route into the Caucasus.
- Move A UKR to RUM to threaten Romania and prepare for future expansion.
- Move A WAR to GAL to threaten Austria and open a new front in the west.
- Hold units in the north for now, but keep flexibility.

This aggressive stance aims to threaten Turkey, Austria, and Romania, while consolidating eastern positions.

**Orders:**

- F SEV S F ANK - ARM (support convoy to threaten Turkey)
- A UKR - RUM (advance into Romania)
- A WAR - GAL (advance into Galicia, threatening Austria)
- A UKR H (hold to maintain flexibility)
- F STP/SC H (hold for now, but ready to support or move as needed)

**Note:** I will support convoy F ANK - ARM if needed in future turns, but for now, I will keep the convoy support implied in the move.

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy maintains a defensive stance with Austria and France, with no new agreements reached. Relationships remain tense, especially with Austria and England. Italy's units are positioned to defend key centers and prepare for potential expansion into the Mediterranean or against Austria. No messages from Germany or Turkey this round, indicating possible disengagement or strategic silence.

[S1901M] I ordered A ROM to NAP to strengthen central Italy, F NAP to ION to secure the Ionian Sea, and I held A VEN to maintain position. The strategy focuses on consolidating Italy's core centers, securing the Mediterranean, and preparing for future expansion against Austria and France while maintaining a defensive stance against Turkey and Russia.

[F1901M] Italy has maintained a defensive stance, focusing on protecting Trieste and Venice from Austria and Germany. No new agreements have been reached this turn, and communication has been consistent but non-committal. Austria and Germany remain hostile, while France and others are neutral or unfriendly. Italy's message silence suggests a cautious approach, avoiding overextension while monitoring threats.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's current position is defensive but with potential for expansion into the Mediterranean and southeastern Europe. Our immediate goal is to secure our core centers (Venice, Rome, Naples) while positioning to threaten Austria and France, and to prepare for future expansion.

Given the map and the current threats, I will focus on consolidating Italy's position, preventing Austrian or German incursions, and positioning fleets to threaten Austria's Trieste and the Balkans, as well as France's southern coast.

- I will support Venice's army to hold, as it is a key border center with Austria.
- I will move the army from Naples to support a future attack on Trieste, or to threaten Austria's BUD if the opportunity arises.
- The fleet in Ionian Sea will move to the Aegean to threaten Greece or support an attack on Bulgaria later.
- The fleet in Trieste will hold to defend against Austria, but I will prepare to support an attack on Trieste from Venice or Ionian if Austria becomes vulnerable.
- I will keep my units in a flexible stance, ready to support or move as the diplomatic situation develops.

This approach maintains a defensive posture while positioning for expansion into Austria's vulnerable centers and the Balkans, aligning with the goal of aggressive expansion and exploiting weaknesses.

**Orders:**

- A VEN S A NAP - APU (supporting Naples to threaten or support an attack on Trieste)
- A NAP - ROM (to secure Naples and prepare for future moves)
- F ION - AEG (to threaten Greece and support future operations in the Balkans)
- F TRI - ADR (to threaten Austria's Trieste and support future moves)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control Berlin, Kiel, and Munich, giving us 3 centers. We need to push into Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and possibly threaten Austria and Russia to weaken their positions and gain more centers.

- Denmark (DEN) is a key target for early expansion, and our fleet in DEN can move to the North Sea (NTH) or support KIE to secure Scandinavia.
- KIE is well-positioned to support DEN or move into Holland (HOL) to threaten the Low Countries.
- We should move F DEN to NTH to threaten England and gain control of the North Sea, opening options for future expansion into the UK or Scandinavia.
- Army in BOH (Bohmen) can support VIE or move to SIL to threaten Austria and open a front in Eastern Europe.
- We should also consider supporting or attacking Austria's centers, especially Vienna and Trieste, to weaken their position.
- Since relationships with Austria and Russia are hostile, aggressive moves into their territories are justified.
- We will hold MUN for now, but prepare to support or move into Austria's centers if opportunities arise.

**Goals for this turn:**
- Secure Scandinavia and the North Sea.
- Threaten Austria's centers.
- Position forces for future expansion into Eastern Europe and the UK.

- F DEN - NTH (to threaten England and control the North Sea)

- A VIE - TYR (to threaten Austria's Vienna and support future attacks)

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Fireworks all across Europe!  England roars out of Edinburgh to plant the Union Jack in the North Sea, fending off Germany’s desperate DEN-to-NTH dash and seizing naval momentum in a single heart-stopping bounce.  Unfazed, the Kaiser swings east as armies pour into Prussia and Silesia, while in the Balkans a triple clash sees Austria stonewall Turkey at Serbia and lock Italy out of Venice—even as the Italian fleet slips past everyone into the Aegean to menace Smyrna.  Russia quietly fortifies Galicia, the board freezes at 4-4-4 for the big dogs, and with no centers traded the real bloodletting now shifts to the winter builds—where tonight’s near-misses will bloom into tomorrow’s betrayals.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Fireworks all across Europe!  England roars out of Edinburgh to plant the Union Jack in the North Sea, fending off Germany’s desperate DEN-to-NTH dash and seizing naval momentum in a single heart-stopping bounce.  Unfazed, the Kaiser swings east as armies pour into Prussia and Silesia, while in the Balkans a triple clash sees Austria stonewall Turkey at Serbia and lock Italy out of Venice—even as the Italian fleet slips past everyone into the Aegean to menace Smyrna.  Russia quietly fortifies Galicia, the board freezes at 4-4-4 for the big dogs, and with no centers traded the real bloodletting now shifts to the winter builds—where tonight’s near-misses will bloom into tomorrow’s betrayals.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Strengthen naval presence in North Sea and English Channel to secure control over key supply centers.
- Solidify alliance with France to contain German expansion and coordinate future moves into Scandinavia and Low Countries.
- Monitor and prepare for potential German aggression in Central Europe, especially in Bohemia and Denmark.
- Maintain cautious diplomacy with Russia and Turkey, avoiding early conflicts while observing their movements for future opportunities.
- Explore options to counter Austria's hostility, possibly through diplomatic engagement or strategic positioning.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Fireworks all across Europe!  England roars out of Edinburgh to plant the Union Jack in the North Sea, fending off Germany’s desperate DEN-to-NTH dash and seizing naval momentum in a single heart-stopping bounce.  Unfazed, the Kaiser swings east as armies pour into Prussia and Silesia, while in the Balkans a triple clash sees Austria stonewall Turkey at Serbia and lock Italy out of Venice—even as the Italian fleet slips past everyone into the Aegean to menace Smyrna.  Russia quietly fortifies Galicia, the board freezes at 4-4-4 for the big dogs, and with no centers traded the real bloodletting now shifts to the winter builds—where tonight’s near-misses will bloom into tomorrow’s betrayals.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and consolidate control over Denmark and Scandinavia to gain early supply centers.
- Advance into Austria's remaining centers, especially Vienna and Trieste, to weaken their position.
- Push into Eastern Europe by threatening Warsaw and Ukraine to challenge Russia's eastern expansion.
- Establish a defensive alliance with France to counterbalance Turkey and Russia.
- Prepare for a potential conflict with Austria and Russia by building forces and securing supply centers in the west and east.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand in the Balkans and secure key centers like Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Constantinople, while maintaining a strong defensive posture against Austria and Italy. Russia remains friendly, so we should continue to coordinate with them to contain Austria and Italy's Balkan ambitions.

Currently, our units are positioned to defend and support Balkan expansion:
- F ANK is positioned to control the Aegean and threaten Greece or support moves into Bulgaria.
- A SMY is holding, ready to support or defend as needed.
- A BUL is in place to contest Bulgaria and support our Balkan interests.

Given the current map and the phase, I see an opportunity to push into Bulgaria and Rumelia, possibly forcing Austria to divert resources. We should also prepare for potential German or Austrian advances into the Balkans or Anatolia.

Orders:
- F ANK will move to BLA to secure the Black Sea flank and threaten Greece or support Balkan moves.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

[S1901M] Austria maintains a defensive stance with unfriendly relations towards Turkey, Germany, England, and France, while keeping a neutral stance with Italy and Russia. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn. The focus remains on consolidating existing positions and preparing for potential expansion in the Balkans and Central Europe.

[S1901M] Ordered A VIE to TRI, F TRI to VEN, A BUD to SER, and A VIE to TRI. Strategic focus on expanding into the Balkans and Italy while maintaining a defensive posture against Turkey and Germany, leveraging Austria's central position for flexible support and future expansion.

[F1901M] No messages involving Austria this turn, indicating a possible focus on internal consolidation or other powers' actions. Relationships remain hostile with Germany, Russia, Turkey, and unfriendly with England and France. Italy remains neutral, providing potential for future cooperation. Current units are positioned defensively in Vienna, Trieste, and Serbia, with borders potentially threatened by German and Turkish activity.

[F1901M] Austria orders a move from Vienna to Trieste to strengthen central position, a fleet from Trieste to Venice to support Italian relations, and holds in Serbia to maintain Balkan stability. The strategy aims to secure key centers, prepare for potential German aggression, and maintain flexibility for alliances.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively into the Balkans and Central Europe, while maintaining a defensive posture against Germany and Turkey. Given the current map and relationships, I will focus on consolidating my Balkan positions, supporting Serbia, and preparing for potential German or Turkish threats.

- I will support Serbia to hold against possible German or Turkish advances.
- I will move Vienna to Trieste to strengthen my central position and prepare for future expansion into Italy or the Balkans.
- I will support Trieste to hold in Venice, maintaining good relations with Italy and preventing Italian expansion.
- Serbia will hold to defend against potential German or Turkish attacks.
- I will prepare to support or move units to respond to threats in the Balkans and Central Europe.

This approach keeps my options open for expansion into Italy, the Balkans, or Central Europe, while defending key positions. It also sets up potential future moves to secure more centers.

**Orders:**

- A VIE to TRI (to strengthen central position and prepare for expansion)
- F TRI to VEN (support Italy's neutrality and maintain good relations)
- A SER to HOL (support Serbia to hold, or alternatively, support a move to Bulgaria if needed, but for now, hold)
- Support A SER to hold in Serbia
- Support A VIE to TRI

**Note:** Since no specific support orders are provided in the list, I will assume the best support options are to support Serbia to hold and Vienna to support itself or move to Trieste.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively into Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, while maintaining a strong western front. Currently, Germany has secured Denmark (F DEN to NTH) and is holding core centers in Berlin, Kiel, and Munich. The focus should be on consolidating Scandinavia, pushing into the Baltic, and preparing for eastern expansion, especially against Russia and Austria.

- Moving F KIE to DEN secures Scandinavia and denies England a foothold there.
- Moving A PRU to Baltic (BALT) or similar would be ideal, but options are limited; instead, I will support the move into Denmark.
- To threaten Russia and potentially gain more centers, I will prepare to push into Warsaw or support an eastern advance.
- Since Austria is unfriendly and Russia is unfriendly, I will keep my fleet in the North Sea (F NTH) for flexibility, possibly supporting future moves.
- Holding Munich and Berlin is prudent for now, but I will consider supporting moves to threaten Austria or Russia if opportunities arise.

Given the current options, I will focus on securing Scandinavia and preparing for eastern expansion, while maintaining a defensive stance in the west.

**Orders:**

- F KIE to DEN to secure Scandinavia.
- A BER to PRU to strengthen the eastern front.
- A MUN to BOH to prepare for eastern expansion.
- F DEN to NTH to support Scandinavian control.
- Support F KIE - DEN to ensure success.
- Support A BER - PRU to threaten Russia or prepare for future moves.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter’s snow can’t muffle the drumbeat of war: Austria, Germany, Russia, and Turkey all stride into 1902 tied at four centers apiece, but Vienna’s surprise army build in Budapest screams Balkan ambition. Berlin answers with a fresh fleet, yet Kaiser Wilhelm’s grand plan for twin shipyards backfires—the Kiel slipways are jam-packed, leaving a would-be North Sea armada dead in the water. Meanwhile the Sultan quietly reinforces Constantinople, hinting at an Ottoman pincer on the Aegean just as Italy’s lone fleet lurks nearby. Tension crackles across Europe; one misstep next spring and this fragile balance will explode into all-out betrayal.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter’s snow can’t muffle the drumbeat of war: Austria, Germany, Russia, and Turkey all stride into 1902 tied at four centers apiece, but Vienna’s surprise army build in Budapest screams Balkan ambition. Berlin answers with a fresh fleet, yet Kaiser Wilhelm’s grand plan for twin shipyards backfires—the Kiel slipways are jam-packed, leaving a would-be North Sea armada dead in the water. Meanwhile the Sultan quietly reinforces Constantinople, hinting at an Ottoman pincer on the Aegean just as Italy’s lone fleet lurks nearby. Tension crackles across Europe; one misstep next spring and this fragile balance will explode into all-out betrayal.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Strengthen alliance with Russia to counter Austria and Italy's Balkan expansion.
- Secure control of Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Constantinople to solidify Balkan and Anatolian positions.
- Prepare to defend against German advances into Bohemia and Denmark, possibly by supporting or defending key positions.
- Engage diplomatically with Italy to prevent their expansion into the Ionian and secure their neutrality or support.
- Monitor and prepare for potential threats from Austria and Germany, while exploiting their focus on each other.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter’s snow can’t muffle the drumbeat of war: Austria, Germany, Russia, and Turkey all stride into 1902 tied at four centers apiece, but Vienna’s surprise army build in Budapest screams Balkan ambition. Berlin answers with a fresh fleet, yet Kaiser Wilhelm’s grand plan for twin shipyards backfires—the Kiel slipways are jam-packed, leaving a would-be North Sea armada dead in the water. Meanwhile the Sultan quietly reinforces Constantinople, hinting at an Ottoman pincer on the Aegean just as Italy’s lone fleet lurks nearby. Tension crackles across Europe; one misstep next spring and this fragile balance will explode into all-out betrayal.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and defend Denmark and Scandinavia to establish early supply centers.
- Exploit Austria and Turkey's conflict to gain control of Balkan centers, especially Vienna, Trieste, and Smyrna.
- Prepare to counter Germany's eastern expansion by reinforcing Silesia and Warsaw.
- Establish a defensive alliance with France to counterbalance Turkey and Russia.
- Monitor and respond to England's naval buildup, possibly seeking naval cooperation or preemptive positioning.
