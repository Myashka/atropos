intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for ITALY in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is ITALY. The S1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.

MESSAGES THIS ROUND
(No messages involving your power this round that require deep reflection for diary. Focus on overall situation.)


All powers have been responsive to your messages.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
[""Survive and expand"", ""Form beneficial alliances"", ""Secure key territories""]

Relationships:
{""TURKEY"": ""Neutral"", ""RUSSIA"": ""Neutral"", ""GERMANY"": ""Neutral"", ""ENGLAND"": ""Neutral"", ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"", ""ITALY"": ""Neutral""}

Game State:
Units: {'AUSTRIA': ['A BUD', 'A VIE', 'F TRI'], 'ENGLAND': ['F EDI', 'F LON', 'A LVP'], 'FRANCE': ['F BRE', 'A MAR', 'A PAR'], 'GERMANY': ['F KIE', 'A BER', 'A MUN'], 'ITALY': ['F NAP', 'A ROM', 'A VEN'], 'RUSSIA': ['A WAR', 'A MOS', 'F SEV', 'F STP/SC'], 'TURKEY': ['F ANK', 'A CON', 'A SMY']}, Centers: {'AUSTRIA': ['BUD', 'TRI', 'VIE'], 'ENGLAND': ['EDI', 'LON', 'LVP'], 'FRANCE': ['BRE', 'MAR', 'PAR'], 'GERMANY': ['BER', 'KIE', 'MUN'], 'ITALY': ['NAP', 'ROM', 'VEN'], 'RUSSIA': ['MOS', 'SEV', 'STP', 'WAR'], 'TURKEY': ['ANK', 'CON', 'SMY']}

TASK
Analyze the negotiations, goals, relationships, and game state to:
1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements
2. State your strategic intent for S1901M
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

{""negotiation_summary"": ""Key outcomes from negotiations"",""intent"": ""Strategic intent for upcoming orders"",""updated_relationships"": {
""POWER_NAME"": ""Enemy|Unfriendly|Neutral|Friendly|Ally""
}
}


Do not include any text outside the JSON.

Analyze the negotiations, goals, relationships, and game state to:
1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements
2. State your strategic intent for S1901M
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
