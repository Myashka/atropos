atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles
    - Paris
  Germany
    - Berlin
    - Kiel
    - Munich
  Italy
    - Naples
    - Rome
    - Venice
  Russia
    - Moscow
    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure control of the Balkans by capturing Serbia (SER) and Romania (RUM) early in the game. This will strengthen my position and provide additional supply centers.
- I have established a friendly relationship with Italy, which I can leverage to ensure that my moves into Serbia and Romania are not contested. Italy has indicated a willingness to hold in Venice (VEN), which allows me to move into Serbia without fear of Italian interference.
- I will move my army from Budapest (BUD) to Serbia (SER) to capture it, and I will also move my army from Vienna (VIE) to Galicia (GAL) to position myself for a future move into Romania (RUM) while keeping my options open against Russia.
- My fleet in Trieste (TRI) will hold position to maintain control of the Adriatic Sea and support any future moves into the Mediterranean.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is focused on securing Denmark and Belgium, while Austria is interested in maintaining neutrality and expanding in the Balkans. England proposes a strong alliance and coordination for mutual growth, but Germany remains cautious. France has not responded to Germany's outreach for a non-aggression pact. Russia suggests a non-aggression pact to maintain stability in the north, which aligns with Germany's interests. Turkey is also looking to expand in the Balkans but has not engaged directly with Germany.

  RUSSIA: Greetings! As we both have mutual interests in maintaining stability in the north, I propose a non-aggression pact between our nations. I will focus on securing Sweden and Rumania, and I hope we can work together to counter any potential threats from England or France. Let me know your thoughts.

   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Denmark (DEN) and Belgium (BEL) early in the game to strengthen my position in Northern Europe.
- The fleet in Kiel (KIE) is well-positioned to move to Denmark, while the army in Munich (MUN) can move to Holland (HOL) and support the capture of Belgium.
- I will hold my units in Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) to ensure they are secure against potential threats from France or Russia.
- I will also consider the potential for a non-aggression pact with Russia, which could allow me to focus on my western front without worrying about an immediate threat from the east.

gpt-4o-mini,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Italy in Spring 1901, my primary goal is to secure Tunis, a neutral supply center, to strengthen my position in the Mediterranean. This will be achieved by moving my fleet from Naples to the Ionian Sea, setting up for a move to Tunis in the fall.

Diplomatically, I have a friendly relationship with Austria, and we have discussed potential collaboration against Turkey or Russia. Therefore, I will hold my army in Venice to maintain a defensive posture and avoid any accidental conflict with Austria. This also keeps my options open for future moves into the Balkans if the situation changes.

My army in Rome will move to Apulia, which positions it for potential future support actions or moves into the Balkans, depending on how the diplomatic landscape evolves.

**Orders:**

- Move Fleet from Naples to the Ionian Sea to prepare for capturing Tunis.
- Hold Army in Venice to maintain a defensive posture and avoid conflict with Austria.
- Move Army from Rome to Apulia to position for future flexibility.

gpt-4o,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is open to peaceful coexistence and potential coordination, while France has not responded to my proposal for a non-aggression pact regarding the English Channel. Russia is interested in cooperation in the north but wants to avoid conflict over Norway, suggesting a focus on Sweden instead. France's silence may indicate other priorities or potential hostility.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As England in Spring 1901, my primary goal is to secure a strong position in the North Sea and surrounding waters, while also expanding into neutral supply centers. Given the current diplomatic landscape, I have a friendly relationship with Germany and a neutral one with Russia, while France has been unresponsive, which could indicate potential hostility.

1. **Fleet in Edinburgh (F EDI):** Moving to the North Sea (NTH) is crucial for establishing naval dominance and positioning for future expansion into Norway or Belgium. This move also allows flexibility in supporting other units or launching future attacks.

2. **Fleet in London (F LON):** Moving to the English Channel (ENG) serves multiple purposes. It positions me to potentially contest Belgium, monitor French movements, and maintain a defensive posture against any unexpected French aggression.

3. **Army in Liverpool (A LVP):** Moving to Yorkshire (YOR) is a strategic positioning move. It allows the army to potentially support future operations in the North Sea or move towards the continent if needed. It also keeps the army mobile and ready to respond to any threats.

These moves align with my strategic goals of securing key naval positions and preparing for expansion into neutral supply centers. They also maintain flexibility to adapt to any changes in the diplomatic landscape.

gpt-4o,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Greetings. I understand we may have some competing interests in the north. I am interested in Norway and would like to avoid conflict if possible. Perhaps we can find a way to coexist peacefully. What are your thoughts on this?
  RUSSIA: Hello! I am interested in discussing potential cooperation in the north. I plan to move towards Sweden and would like to ensure we do not have any conflicts over Norway. Perhaps we can coordinate our efforts to keep Germany in check. Looking forward to your response.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  RUSSIA: Greetings! As we both have mutual interests in maintaining stability in the north, I propose a non-aggression pact between our nations. I will focus on securing Sweden and Rumania, and I hope we can work together to counter any potential threats from England or France. Let me know your thoughts.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  RUSSIA: Greetings. I am reaching out to discuss the situation in the Black Sea. I propose a temporary demilitarization of the area to avoid unnecessary conflict. This could allow us to focus on other fronts and potentially explore future cooperation. Please let me know your stance.
  TURKEY: Russia, I believe it would be in our best interests to avoid conflict in the early game. I suggest we focus on our respective territories and avoid any aggressive moves towards each other. What do you think?

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  RUSSIA: Hello. I understand we have had some tensions, but I believe there is room for cooperation. I am interested in securing Rumania and would like to avoid conflict with you in Galicia. Perhaps we can find a way to work together against common threats. Let me know if you are open to discussions.

    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Russia in Spring 1901, my primary objectives are to secure neutral supply centers and establish a strong position in both the north and south. The key targets for this phase are Sweden and Rumania. Additionally, I aim to establish a presence in the Black Sea to exert pressure on Turkey and secure my southern flank.

1. **Fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV):** Moving to the Black Sea (BLA) is crucial to exert pressure on Turkey and secure my southern flank. This move aligns with my conversation with Turkey, where we agreed to avoid early conflict, but it also positions me strategically for future actions.

2. **Army in Moscow (A MOS):** Moving to Ukraine (UKR) positions this army to support a future move into Rumania or to reinforce the southern front. This move is non-aggressive towards Austria, aligning with my message to them about avoiding conflict in Galicia.

3. **Army in Warsaw (A WAR):** Moving to Galicia (GAL) is a strategic move to apply pressure on Austria and potentially support future actions in the Balkans. It also serves as a defensive measure against any Austrian aggression.

4. **Fleet in St. Petersburg (F STP/SC):** Moving to the Gulf of Bothnia (BOT) positions this fleet to support a future move into Sweden. This aligns with my conversation with England, where we agreed to avoid conflict over Norway, allowing me to focus on Sweden.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
We’re off to a roaring start as England double-splashes into the North Sea and English Channel, daring both France and Germany to blink first! In the east, the powder keg ignites: Russia’s drive to Ukraine meets an Austrian leap into Serbia while the Black Sea explodes in a triple bounce, locking Sevastopol, Ankara, and Constantinople in a deadly stare-down. Germany muscles into Denmark and Italy slips its fleet into the Ionian, hinting at a possible Lepanto while France turtles up, fortifying every homeland center. No SCs change hands yet, but the board is crackling—alliances are unspoken, knives are sharpened, and someone’s about to get cut in the Fall!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
We’re off to a roaring start as England double-splashes into the North Sea and English Channel, daring both France and Germany to blink first! In the east, the powder keg ignites: Russia’s drive to Ukraine meets an Austrian leap into Serbia while the Black Sea explodes in a triple bounce, locking Sevastopol, Ankara, and Constantinople in a deadly stare-down. Germany muscles into Denmark and Italy slips its fleet into the Ionian, hinting at a possible Lepanto while France turtles up, fortifying every homeland center. No SCs change hands yet, but the board is crackling—alliances are unspoken, knives are sharpened, and someone’s about to get cut in the Fall!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure control of the North Sea and surrounding waters to ensure naval dominance and protect the British Isles.
- Expand into neutral supply centers such as Norway, Belgium, and potentially Holland to increase supply base.
- Establish a strong diplomatic position with France and Germany to prevent early conflicts and focus on expansion.

Power: GERMANY
Phase: F1901M

Current Goals: - Secure Belgium in the Fall to strengthen position in Northern Europe.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is focused on securing Denmark and Belgium, while Austria is interested in maintaining neutrality and expanding in the Balkans. England proposes a strong alliance and coordination for mutual growth, but Germany remains cautious. France has not responded to Germany's outreach for a non-aggression pact. Russia suggests a non-aggression pact to maintain stability in the north, which aligns with Germany's interests. Turkey is also looking to expand in the Balkans but has not engaged directly with Germany.

[S1901M] Germany has issued orders to move F KIE to DEN, A MUN to RUH, and A BER is holding. The intent is to secure Denmark for a stronger northern position while maintaining a defensive stance in Berlin. The focus is on expanding influence in Northern Europe and preparing for potential conflicts with France.

Current Goals: - Secure Norway by moving into the North Sea and then to Norway.
- Maintain control of the English Channel to pressure France and protect against potential aggression.
- Strengthen diplomatic ties with Germany to ensure cooperation and prevent a two-front conflict.
- Monitor eastern developments, particularly Russian movements, to anticipate any northern threats.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is open to peaceful coexistence and potential coordination, while France has not responded to my proposal for a non-aggression pact regarding the English Channel. Russia is interested in cooperation in the north but wants to avoid conflict over Norway, suggesting a focus on Sweden instead. France's silence may indicate other priorities or potential hostility.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Edinburgh to the North Sea, Fleet London to the English Channel, and Army Liverpool to Yorkshire. These moves aim to secure naval dominance in the North Sea and position for potential expansion into neutral supply centers like Norway and Belgium, while maintaining a friendly stance with Germany and a cautious approach towards France.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Turkey is focused on securing Bulgaria and Rumania early, with a friendly overture to Austria for support against Russia. Italy has expressed a desire to improve relations, while Russia proposed a demilitarization of the Black Sea to avoid conflict. Austria has not yet responded to Turkey's proposal for cooperation.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria and establish a naval presence in the Black Sea while preparing for potential expansion into the Balkans.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] England is open to peaceful coexistence in the north, expressing interest in Norway while I focus on Sweden. Turkey agrees to avoid early conflict, suggesting a focus on respective territories. Germany and Austria have not responded, indicating possible indifference or other priorities. Austria's global message suggests a focus on the Balkans, which may align with my interests in Rumania.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move F SEV to BLA to establish control over the Black Sea, A MOS to UKR to position for Rumania, A WAR to GAL to pressure Austria, and F STP/SC to BOT to secure a path to Sweden. These moves aim to secure key supply centers and establish a strong strategic position in the south and north.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria is open to collaboration in the Balkans and Mediterranean, suggesting potential coordination against Turkey or Russia. France and Turkey have not responded to my messages, indicating possible indifference or other priorities. Austria seems willing to work together, but no concrete agreements have been made yet.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Naples to Ionian Sea to prepare for securing Tunis, hold Army Venice to maintain a defensive position, and move Army Rome to Apulia to support future operations in the Balkans or southern France. Focus on strengthening position in the Mediterranean and maintaining friendly relations with Austria.

--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a friendly dialogue with Italy, discussing potential collaboration against Turkey and Russia. Germany expressed interest in a neutral stance and potential alliance, while Russia proposed cooperation to avoid conflict over Rumania. Turkey is seeking support for its expansion into Bulgaria and Rumania. Overall, there is a mix of potential alliances and threats in the region, particularly from Turkey and Russia.

[S1901M] Austria has issued orders to move Army from Budapest to Serbia, Army from Vienna to Galicia, and hold the Fleet in Trieste. The intent is to secure Serbia for a strong foothold in the Balkans and to position for potential expansion into Romania while maintaining a defensive stance in the Adriatic.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",

gpt-4o-mini,TURKEY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is TURKEY. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: TURKEY
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Capture Rumania and Bulgaria to secure the Balkans early.
- Establish a strong naval presence in the Black Sea to deter Russian aggression.
- Form a temporary alliance with Austria to focus on mutual threats from Russia and Italy.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Friendly
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Neutral
- GERMANY: Neutral
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Turkey is focused on securing Bulgaria and Rumania early, with a friendly overture to Austria for support against Russia. Italy has expressed a desire to improve relations, while Russia proposed a demilitarization of the Black Sea to avoid conflict. Austria has not yet responded to Turkey's proposal for cooperation.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria and establish a naval presence in the Black Sea while preparing for potential expansion into the Balkans.

[F1901M] Turkey has established a friendly dialogue with Austria, proposing a temporary understanding to coordinate moves in the Balkans. Austria is supportive of Turkey's ambitions in Rumania. Communication with England and Italy is neutral, with both expressing openness to future cooperation. Russia has indicated a desire to avoid conflict but is focused on Rumania, which may lead to tensions. No responses have been received from France or Germany, indicating potential indifference or prioritization of other relationships.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello Turkey, I see that we have mutual interests in the Balkans. However, I am also looking to secure Rumania for Austria. I propose we discuss a temporary understanding where we can both expand without stepping on each other's toes. How do you feel about coordinating our moves?
  TURKEY: Hello Austria, I hope we can solidify our cooperation against the common threats from Russia and Italy. I plan to move my army from Bulgaria to Rumania this turn, and I would appreciate your support in this endeavor. Together, we can secure the Balkans and strengthen our positions.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Greetings! I wish you success in your endeavors in the Balkans. While our interests do not directly overlap at the moment, I am open to discussing potential future cooperation or agreements that could benefit both our powers.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ITALY: Greetings Turkey, I see you are looking to expand in the Balkans. Italy is focused on securing Tunis and maintaining stability in the Mediterranean. I am open to discussing potential agreements that could benefit both our nations.
  TURKEY: Dear Italy, I appreciate your desire to improve relations. While I have no immediate plans against you, I am focused on securing my position in the Balkans. Let's keep communication open and see how we can mutually benefit from our respective goals.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  RUSSIA: Hello! I agree that avoiding early conflict is beneficial for both of us. I am focusing on securing Rumania and have no aggressive intentions towards you. Let's maintain peace in the Black Sea and focus on our respective expansions.
  TURKEY: Greetings Russia, I appreciate your proposal for demilitarization of the Black Sea. However, I must prioritize securing Bulgaria and Rumania first. I suggest we keep the lines of communication open, but I cannot agree to demilitarization at this time. Let's focus on avoiding conflict while I solidify my position.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

[S1901M] Germany is focused on securing Denmark and Belgium, while Austria is interested in maintaining neutrality and expanding in the Balkans. England proposes a strong alliance and coordination for mutual growth, but Germany remains cautious. France has not responded to Germany's outreach for a non-aggression pact.

[S1901M] Established a friendly dialogue with Italy, discussing potential collaboration against Turkey and Russia. Germany expressed interest in a neutral stance and potential alliance, while Russia proposed cooperation to avoid conflict over Rumania. Turkey is seeking support for its expansion into Bulgaria and Rumania. Overall, there is a mix of potential alliances and threats in the region, particularly from Turkey and Russia.

[S1901M] Austria has issued orders to move Army from Budapest to Serbia, Army from Vienna to Galicia, and hold the Fleet in Trieste. The intent is to secure Serbia for a strong foothold in the Balkans and to position for potential expansion into Romania while maintaining a defensive stance in the Adriatic.

[F1901M] Austria is seeking to secure Rumania and has proposed a non-aggression pact with Russia while also discussing cooperation with Turkey. Turkey is looking for support in Rumania, while Italy has proposed a coordinated strategy against Turkey. Germany has expressed a desire for collaboration, but Austria's focus remains on the Balkans. Overall, there is a mix of potential alliances and competing interests in the region.

MESSAGES THIS ROUND
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 AUSTRIA: To all powers in the region, I am open to discussions about potential alliances and agreements. Austria is looking to secure its position in the Balkans and would like to ensure stability in our interactions. Let's work together to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
 GERMANY: To all powers: As we enter this new phase, I encourage open communication and collaboration. I believe that a stable and cooperative environment will benefit us all. Let's work together to ensure our mutual growth and security.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello Russia, I appreciate your message and the offer for cooperation. However, I must prioritize securing Rumania for myself. I suggest we both focus on our respective interests and avoid conflict in Galicia. Perhaps we can agree to a non-aggression pact for now?

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  AUSTRIA: Hello Turkey, I see that we have mutual interests in the Balkans. However, I am also looking to secure Rumania for Austria. I propose we discuss a temporary understanding where we can both expand without stepping on each other's toes. How do you feel about coordinating our moves?
  TURKEY: Hello Austria, I hope we can solidify our cooperation against the common threats from Russia and Italy. I plan to move my army from Bulgaria to Rumania this turn, and I would appreciate your support in this endeavor. Together, we can secure the Balkans and strengthen our positions.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ITALY: Greetings Austria, I am pleased to hear about your interest in establishing a strong foothold in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. I propose we coordinate a Lepanto strategy against Turkey to secure our positions. Let's discuss how we can best support each other in this endeavor.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Romania this turn, which is crucial for my expansion into the Balkans. I will move my Army from Serbia (A SER) to Romania (A SER - RUM) to capture it.
- I will hold my Fleet in Trieste (F TRI H) to maintain a defensive position in the Adriatic and to support my Army in Serbia if needed.
- My Army in Vienna (A VIE) will move to Galicia (A VIE - GAL) to position myself for future moves and to monitor Russian activities in the region.

This strategy allows me to secure Romania while also preparing for potential threats from Russia and Turkey. I will maintain my alliance with Italy and keep communication open with Germany to ensure stability in the region.

gpt-4o,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is ENGLAND. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: ENGLAND
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure Norway by moving into the North Sea and then to Norway.
- Maintain control of the English Channel to pressure France and protect against potential aggression.
- Strengthen diplomatic ties with Germany to ensure cooperation and prevent a two-front conflict.
- Monitor eastern developments, particularly Russian movements, to anticipate any northern threats.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Neutral
- FRANCE: Unfriendly
- GERMANY: Friendly
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Neutral
- TURKEY: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is open to peaceful coexistence and potential coordination, while France has not responded to my proposal for a non-aggression pact regarding the English Channel. Russia is interested in cooperation in the north but wants to avoid conflict over Norway, suggesting a focus on Sweden instead. France's silence may indicate other priorities or potential hostility.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Edinburgh to the North Sea, Fleet London to the English Channel, and Army Liverpool to Yorkshire. These moves aim to secure naval dominance in the North Sea and position for potential expansion into neutral supply centers like Norway and Belgium, while maintaining a friendly stance with Germany and a cautious approach towards France.

[F1901M] Germany is open to coordinating moves, particularly regarding Belgium and Denmark, which aligns with my interests in maintaining stability in Northern Europe. Russia has agreed to avoid conflict over Norway, focusing instead on Sweden, and is open to cooperation against Germany if needed. France has not responded to my non-aggression proposal, indicating potential hostility or other priorities. Turkey has not responded either, but our interests do not currently overlap significantly.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As England, my primary goal in this phase is to secure Norway and maintain a strong position in the North Sea while keeping an eye on potential threats from France. Given the current diplomatic landscape, I have a friendly relationship with Germany and a neutral one with Russia, which allows me to focus on expansion without immediate concern for conflict in the north. France's lack of response to my non-aggression proposal suggests potential hostility, so I must be cautious about their movements.

1. **Fleet in the North Sea (F NTH):** I will move this fleet to Norway (NWY) to secure the supply center there. This move aligns with my goal of expansion and is supported by Russia's agreement to avoid conflict over Norway.

2. **Fleet in the English Channel (F ENG):** I will move this fleet to Belgium (BEL). This move serves two purposes: it allows me to potentially secure another supply center and applies pressure on France, who has been unresponsive and potentially hostile. Additionally, this move can be seen as a supportive gesture towards Germany, who is interested in Belgium.

3. **Army in Yorkshire (A YOR):** I will move this army to London (LON) to ensure the defense of my home centers and maintain flexibility for future moves. This move also allows me to potentially convoy the army to the continent in future turns if needed.

gpt-4o,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] England is open to peaceful coexistence in the north, expressing interest in Norway while I focus on Sweden. Turkey agrees to avoid early conflict, suggesting a focus on respective territories. Germany and Austria have not responded, indicating possible indifference or other priorities. Austria's global message suggests a focus on the Balkans, which may align with my interests in Rumania.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move F SEV to BLA to establish control over the Black Sea, A MOS to UKR to position for Rumania, A WAR to GAL to pressure Austria, and F STP/SC to BOT to secure a path to Sweden. These moves aim to secure key supply centers and establish a strong strategic position in the south and north.

[F1901M] Austria is focused on securing Rumania and suggests a non-aggression pact. England is open to cooperation in the north and wants to avoid conflict over Norway. Germany is interested in a non-aggression pact and is focused on Denmark and Belgium. Turkey is unwilling to demilitarize the Black Sea and is focused on securing Bulgaria and Rumania.

  RUSSIA: Hi there! I am moving towards Sweden and have no interest in Norway, as we discussed. Let's continue our peaceful coexistence in the north. If Germany becomes aggressive, we might consider coordinating our efforts.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Greetings! I am open to discussing a non-aggression pact. It aligns with my interests in maintaining stability in the north. However, I would like to ensure that our mutual goals do not conflict, especially regarding England. Let's keep communication open as we navigate our strategies.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  RUSSIA: Hello! I agree that avoiding early conflict is beneficial for both of us. I am focusing on securing Rumania and have no aggressive intentions towards you. Let's maintain peace in the Black Sea and focus on our respective expansions.
  TURKEY: Greetings Russia, I appreciate your proposal for demilitarization of the Black Sea. However, I must prioritize securing Bulgaria and Rumania first. I suggest we keep the lines of communication open, but I cannot agree to demilitarization at this time. Let's focus on avoiding conflict while I solidify my position.

2. **F SEV - BLA**: The fleet in Sevastopol (SEV) will move to the Black Sea (BLA) to establish a strategic position against Turkey. Despite Turkey's reluctance to demilitarize the Black Sea, controlling this area is crucial for Russian security and future operations in the south.

3. **A UKR - RUM**: The army in Ukraine (UKR) will move to Rumania (RUM) to capture this neutral supply center. This move is essential for expanding Russian influence in the Balkans and aligns with the strategic goal of securing Rumania.

4. **A WAR - GAL**: The army in Warsaw (WAR) will move to Galicia (GAL) to apply pressure on Austria and potentially support future operations in the Balkans. This move also serves as a defensive posture against any Austrian aggression.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria is open to collaboration in the Balkans and Mediterranean, suggesting potential coordination against Turkey or Russia. France and Turkey have not responded to my messages, indicating possible indifference or other priorities. Austria seems willing to work together, but no concrete agreements have been made yet.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Naples to Ionian Sea to prepare for securing Tunis, hold Army Venice to maintain a defensive position, and move Army Rome to Apulia to support future operations in the Balkans or southern France. Focus on strengthening position in the Mediterranean and maintaining friendly relations with Austria.

[F1901M] Austria is open to discussions about alliances, and I proposed a Lepanto strategy against Turkey. Germany is interested in maintaining open communication and stability, but has not responded to my message. Turkey is focused on the Balkans and open to discussions, but their intentions remain unclear. France has not responded to my message, indicating potential indifference or hostility.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Secure Tunis:** The primary goal for this phase is to secure the neutral supply center in Tunis. This will strengthen Italy's position in the Mediterranean and provide an additional build in the next phase. The fleet in the Ionian Sea (F ION) will convoy the army from Apulia (A APU) to Tunis.

2. **Maintain Defensive Position:** The army in Venice (A VEN) will hold its position to ensure the security of the Italian homeland and to maintain a defensive posture against any potential Austrian aggression. This also keeps the option open for future coordination with Austria.

3. **Prepare for Future Operations:** The army in Apulia (A APU) will be convoyed to Tunis, which will allow Italy to project power further into the Mediterranean and potentially support future operations against Turkey or France.

**Orders:**

- **A APU - TUN VIA Convoy:** This move secures the neutral supply center in Tunis, expanding Italy's control in the Mediterranean.
- **F ION C A APU - TUN:** The fleet in the Ionian Sea will convoy the army from Apulia to Tunis, ensuring the success of the move.
- **A VEN H:** The army in Venice will hold to maintain a defensive position and protect against any potential threats from Austria or France.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Italy stole the spotlight as a dazzling Ionian convoy rocketed an Apulian army into Tunis, chalking up Rome’s first overseas prize and vaulting it to four centers. In the icy north the hunters were busy too: England cruised into Norway while the Russian bear padded into Sweden, each pocketing new loot and setting Scandinavia ablaze. Belgium became a cratered wasteland after an Anglo-German pile-up, and the Balkans seethed with triple bounces that sealed the Black Sea and froze Rumania in a deadly Austro-Russo-Turkish vise. Russia still tops the table at five, but with fresh blood in Africa, a Scandinavian arms race, and mistrust crackling from Brest to Ankara, Winter 1901 is primed for fireworks.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Italy stole the spotlight as a dazzling Ionian convoy rocketed an Apulian army into Tunis, chalking up Rome’s first overseas prize and vaulting it to four centers. In the icy north the hunters were busy too: England cruised into Norway while the Russian bear padded into Sweden, each pocketing new loot and setting Scandinavia ablaze. Belgium became a cratered wasteland after an Anglo-German pile-up, and the Balkans seethed with triple bounces that sealed the Black Sea and froze Rumania in a deadly Austro-Russo-Turkish vise. Russia still tops the table at five, but with fresh blood in Africa, a Scandinavian arms race, and mistrust crackling from Brest to Ankara, Winter 1901 is primed for fireworks.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure Norway by moving into the North Sea and then to Norway.
- Maintain control of the English Channel to pressure France and protect against potential aggression.
- Strengthen diplomatic ties with Germany to ensure cooperation and prevent a two-front conflict.
- Monitor eastern developments, particularly Russian movements, to anticipate any northern threats.

gpt-4o-mini,TURKEY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Turkey is focused on securing Bulgaria and Rumania early, with a friendly overture to Austria for support against Russia. Italy has expressed a desire to improve relations, while Russia proposed a demilitarization of the Black Sea to avoid conflict. Austria has not yet responded to Turkey's proposal for cooperation.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria and establish a naval presence in the Black Sea while preparing for potential expansion into the Balkans.

[F1901M] Turkey has established a friendly dialogue with Austria, proposing a temporary understanding to coordinate moves in the Balkans. Austria is supportive of Turkey's ambitions in Rumania. Communication with England and Italy is neutral, with both expressing openness to future cooperation. Russia has indicated a desire to avoid conflict but is focused on Rumania, which may lead to tensions. No responses have been received from France or Germany, indicating potential indifference or prioritization of other relationships.

[F1901M] Moved Army from Bulgaria to Rumania to secure the Balkans, deployed Fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea to establish naval presence and deter Russia, and held Army in Smyrna for defense.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Bulgaria and Rumania early in the game to establish a strong foothold in the Balkans.
- Moving the Army from Constantinople to Bulgaria will allow me to capture this supply center, while the Fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea will establish a naval presence to deter Russian aggression and potentially support future moves into Rumania.
- Holding the Army in Smyrna is essential for defense and maintaining my home centers.
- I have a friendly relationship with Austria, which I can leverage to coordinate against Russia, who is also eyeing Rumania.

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

[S1901M] Austria is open to collaboration in the Balkans and Mediterranean, suggesting potential coordination against Turkey or Russia. France and Turkey have not responded to my messages, indicating possible indifference or other priorities. Austria seems willing to work together, but no concrete agreements have been made yet.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Naples to Ionian Sea to prepare for securing Tunis, hold Army Venice to maintain a defensive position, and move Army Rome to Apulia to support future operations in the Balkans or southern France. Focus on strengthening position in the Mediterranean and maintaining friendly relations with Austria.

[F1901M] Austria is open to discussions about alliances, and I proposed a Lepanto strategy against Turkey. Germany is interested in maintaining open communication and stability, but has not responded to my message. Turkey is focused on the Balkans and open to discussions, but their intentions remain unclear. France has not responded to my message, indicating potential indifference or hostility.

[F1901M] Issued orders to move Army Apulia to Tunis via convoy by Fleet Ionian Sea, securing a neutral supply center in the Mediterranean. Army Venice holds position to maintain defense and flexibility. These moves support the strategy of strengthening Italy's Mediterranean presence and preparing for potential collaboration with Austria against Turkey, while monitoring France's actions.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Italy in the Winter 1901 Adjustment phase, my primary focus is on building units to strengthen my position and prepare for future expansion. I have successfully secured Tunis, which provides me with an additional supply center, allowing me to build one new unit. Given the current strategic situation, I need to bolster my naval presence in the Mediterranean to counter potential threats from France and Turkey and to support future operations in the Eastern Mediterranean.

1. **Build Fleet in Naples (F NAP B):** This will enhance my naval capabilities in the Mediterranean, allowing me to project power and defend against any French or Turkish advances. It also positions me well for potential future operations in the Eastern Mediterranean, in line with the Lepanto strategy against Turkey.

By focusing on naval strength, I can maintain control over the Mediterranean and support my strategic goals of expansion and securing additional supply centers.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

As Russia, my primary goal is to expand my influence and secure additional supply centers while maintaining a strong defensive position. Given the current state of the board and relationships with other powers, my strategy for the Winter 1901 Adjustment phase is as follows:

1. **Build Orders:**
   - I have gained control of Sweden, which provides me with an additional supply center. This allows me to build an additional unit.
   - I will build a fleet in Saint Petersburg (North Coast) to strengthen my naval presence in the north. This will help me maintain control over Scandinavia and potentially threaten England or Germany if necessary.
   - I will also build an army in Moscow to bolster my land forces. This will provide flexibility to either defend against potential threats from Austria or Turkey or to push further into the Balkans.

2. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **Austria:** My relationship with Austria is unfriendly, and I have positioned my army in Galicia to pressure them. The additional army in Moscow can support operations in the south if needed.
   - **Turkey:** Turkey is also unfriendly, and I need to maintain a strong position in the Black Sea. The fleet in Sevastopol will continue to be crucial in this area.
   - **England and Germany:** Both are currently friendly, but I must remain vigilant. The new fleet in Saint Petersburg will help secure my northern flank and provide options for future expansion or defense.

[F1901M] Germany is open to coordinating moves, particularly regarding Belgium and Denmark, which aligns with my interests in maintaining stability in Northern Europe. Russia has agreed to avoid conflict over Norway, focusing instead on Sweden, and is open to cooperation against Germany if needed.
