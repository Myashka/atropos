atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

TASK
Analyze the negotiations, goals, relationships, and game state to:
1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements
2. State your strategic intent for S1901M
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

{""negotiation_summary"": ""Key outcomes from negotiations"",""intent"": ""Strategic intent for upcoming orders"",""updated_relationships"": {
""POWER_NAME"": ""Enemy|Unfriendly|Neutral|Friendly|Ally""
}
}


Do not include any text outside the JSON.

EXAMPLES:

Scenario 1: As France, after discussing a joint move against Germany with England, while Italy seems to be posturing aggressively in Piedmont.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: ITALY
Phase: S1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and expand in Italy's core regions by establishing control over key supply centers such as Trieste, Venice, and Rome, while preparing to challenge Austria and France for nearby centers.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to coordinate early expansion into the Western Mediterranean and potentially isolate Austria and Germany, while maintaining flexibility to shift alliances if necessary.
- Monitor Turkey and Russia closely, avoiding early conflicts with them, but prepare to exploit any overextension or weakness in their positions to gain additional supply centers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy has established a friendly relationship with France, focusing on potential cooperation in the Western Mediterranean. No direct agreements have been finalized, but the tone remains cooperative. Austria and Russia are perceived as unfriendly, with no active negotiations. Germany and England remain neutral, with no recent communication. Turkey is also unfriendly, but no negotiations are ongoing. Italy's units are positioned defensively in NAP, ROM, and VEN, with a focus on consolidating core centers.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate focus is on consolidating control over Italy’s core centers (Naples, Rome, Venice) and positioning for expansion into nearby supply centers. Given the current map and the friendly relationship with France, we should aim to secure the western Mediterranean and prepare for future expansion into Austria and France.

- NAP is currently held by F NAP, and it’s a key coastal position for both defense and expansion.
- ROM is held by A ROM, and it’s vital to keep it secure while pushing for additional centers.
- VEN is held by A VEN, and it’s a strategic position for attacking Austria’s TRI or supporting future moves.

Our best move is to prepare for an attack on Trieste (TRI), which is controlled by Austria and is a critical target for expansion. Moving A VEN to TRI with support from A APU and F ION will help us take TRI, gaining a valuable supply center and putting pressure on Austria.

Supporting the attack from VEN with A APU and F ION increases our chances of success. The fleet in ION can support the attack on TRI from the sea, and the army in VEN can move to TRI, supported by A APU.

Holding ROM and NAP for now ensures stability and keeps our centers secure. We can consider future moves into Greece or further into Austria depending on how the situation develops.

**Orders:**
- Attack Trieste with VEN supported by APU and ION.
- Hold ROM and NAP to maintain control of our core centers.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand and secure supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control 3 centers (EDI, LON, LVP). We need to aggressively push into neighboring neutral centers to increase our holdings.

- The most immediate targets are Belgium (BEL), Holland (HOL), and Denmark (DEN), which are all within reach and can be taken quickly.
- Moving F EDI to NTH (North Sea) will threaten Germany’s key centers and open up options for future expansion.
- Moving F LON to YOR (Yorkshire) or NTH (North Sea) can threaten Germany and support future pushes.
- Supporting moves from LVP to YOR or NTH can help secure these areas and prepare for further expansion.
- Since France is friendly, we can avoid conflict there for now and focus on German and Dutch expansion.
- We should also consider supporting moves to secure our current centers and prepare for future assaults.

The plan is to:
- Use the fleet in EDI to threaten or take NTH, disrupting Germany.
- Use the fleet in LON to threaten or take YOR or NTH.
- Use the army in LVP to support YOR or NTH to secure those regions.
- Keep options open for future moves into Belgium, Holland, and Denmark.

**Orders:**
- F EDI - NTH (to threaten Germany and open expansion options)
- F LON - YOR (to threaten or take Yorkshire)
- A LVP - YOR (to support the fleet and secure Yorkshire)
- Support from LVP to YOR to ensure control
- Hold or support as needed to maintain current centers

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is rapid expansion in the East and Balkans to secure additional supply centers. Currently, we control Moscow, Sevastopol, St. Petersburg, and Warsaw, with potential targets in Rumania, Bulgaria, and the Turkish-controlled centers.

- **Moscow (MOS):** I will move to Lviv to threaten Austria and open a new front, while also keeping options open for future expansion into Ukraine or supporting other units.
- **Sevastopol (SEV):** I will support the move to Baku, aiming to threaten Turkey and expand influence in the Caucasus.
- **War (WAR):** I will support the move to Galicia, aiming to take BUD from Austria and push into the Balkans.
- **Units support and positioning:** I will support the move from WAR to Galicia with WAR supporting, and move MOS to LVN to threaten the Austrian flank.
- **Support and flexibility:** I will keep options open for supporting or holding units depending on enemy responses.

This aggressive stance aims to seize RUM, BUL, and potentially BLA or CON in subsequent turns, setting up for a quick push toward 18 centers.

**Orders:**

- A MOS - LVN
- A WAR - GAL
- F SEV - BAK
- A WAR S A MOS - GAL
- A MOS S A WAR - UKR (supporting the move to Galicia)
- F SEV S F ARM (supporting the move to Baku, if needed)

**Note:** Since only the listed moves are available, I will choose the most aggressive and strategic options to maximize expansion potential.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Italy to secure additional supply centers. Currently, our units are positioned defensively, but we need to shift toward offensive moves to capitalize on opportunities.

- The most immediate target is RUM and SER, which are unclaimed and only one move away. Securing RUM and SER will give us two more centers, bringing us closer to our goal.
- Moving A BUD to RUM is a strong opening, as it threatens the Romanian supply center and puts pressure on the eastern flank.
- Supporting A VIE to TRI can help us take Trieste from Italy, which is a valuable move given Italy's neutrality and our goal to control more centers.
- Moving F TRI to VEN supports the attack on Trieste and prepares for future expansion into Italy.
- Holding Vienna (A VIE) and Budapest (A BUD) for now maintains a defensive posture while we prepare to push into RUM and SER.
- The support moves aim to maximize our expansion potential while maintaining a flexible defense.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A VIE - TRI (supporting Vienna to Trieste, attacking Italy's key center)
- A VIE - BUD (moving Vienna to support Budapest, maintaining flexibility)
- A RUM - SER (aiming to take Serbia, a nearby unclaimed center)
- F TRI - VEN (attacking Italy's Venice, supporting the move from Trieste)
- A ROM H (hold Rome to avoid overextension and keep a strong position in Italy)

This plan aims to secure RUM and SER quickly, threaten Italy's centers, and position Austria for further expansion in the Balkans and Italy.

**PARSABLE OUTPUT:**

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively while consolidating our core positions. Currently, Germany controls Berlin, Kiel, and Munich, with potential to push into neighboring neutral centers and weaken Russia and France.

- The fleet in Kiel (F KIE) is well-positioned to take Denmark (DEN) or support an attack into Holland (HOL). Securing DEN early is crucial for controlling the Baltic and opening a route into Scandinavia.
- The army in Berlin (A BER) can either hold or support an attack into Prussia (PRU) or support MUN to push into the Low Countries.
- Munich (A MUN) is a strong staging point for an attack into the Low Countries or into Russia via the east.
- Since Russia is unfriendly and controls St. Petersburg (STP), and we want to push eastward, I will support an attack into PRU to threaten Russia and open a front.
- The support from MUN to SIL (Silesia) can help us push into Poland or support a move into the Baltic.
- The fleet in KIE can move to HOL or DEN to threaten or secure those centers.
- The overall plan is to push into Denmark and Holland, threaten Russia’s Baltic holdings, and prepare for a broader eastern push.

**Orders:**

- F KIE - DEN (to secure Denmark and threaten the Baltic)
- A BER - PRU (to threaten Russia and open a front)
- A MUN - SIL (to support expansion into Poland or threaten the Baltic)
- A BER S A MUN - SIL (supporting the move into SIL)
- F KIE S A BER - PRU (supporting the attack on PRU)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia to secure key supply centers and build a strong foothold. Russia is friendly, so we should coordinate with them to contain Austria and push into the eastern centers. Italy, France, and Germany are hostile, so we need to be cautious about their movements but also look for opportunities to exploit their overextensions.

Currently, our units are positioned to threaten Bulgaria, Rumania, and Constantinople. The most immediate and strategic move is to secure Bulgaria (BUL) and Rumania (RUM) to expand our control in the Balkans, while also maintaining pressure on Constantinople (CON) to threaten the Western powers and prepare for future expansion.

Given the options, I will:
- Support our fleet in ANK to move into Bulgaria (BUL) to secure it.
- Use our army in SMY to support the move into Rumania (RUM) from the south, or prepare to support a move into Constantinople if needed.
- Keep our fleet in ANK on the coast to threaten the Black Sea and support the expansion into Bulgaria.
- Prepare to support or hold in Smyrna depending on enemy threats.

This aggressive stance will help us secure more centers and set the stage for further expansion into the Balkans and Anatolia.

**Orders:**
- F ANK - BLA (to threaten Bulgaria)
- A SMY - RUM (to threaten Rumania)
- A CON - BUL (to secure Bulgaria)
- F SEV - ARM (to threaten Russia and support our expansion)
- A SMY S A CON - BUL (support move into Bulgaria from Smyrna)

**Note:** The support order for A SMY is to ensure Bulgaria falls if contested, and the fleet in SEV supports the Black Sea expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates as England’s twin fleets spearhead into the North Sea and Yorkshire while Germany scoops up Denmark, leaving France nervously turtled on its coasts. In the east, Russia drives a bayonet into Austria by slipping into Galicia, and Turkey doubles down with the Black Sea–Bulgaria one-two punch that slams the door on Vienna’s southern lifeline. Sensing weakness, Italy lunges for Trieste but is met by a wild three-way pile-up that strands every Austrian unit and exposes the Habsburgs as isolated and out of sync. No centers fall—yet—but the Bear and the Crescent now tighten a vise on Austria, and Britannia rules the waves, setting the board for an explosive autumn.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates as England’s twin fleets spearhead into the North Sea and Yorkshire while Germany scoops up Denmark, leaving France nervously turtled on its coasts. In the east, Russia drives a bayonet into Austria by slipping into Galicia, and Turkey doubles down with the Black Sea–Bulgaria one-two punch that slams the door on Vienna’s southern lifeline. Sensing weakness, Italy lunges for Trieste but is met by a wild three-way pile-up that strands every Austrian unit and exposes the Habsburgs as isolated and out of sync. No centers fall—yet—but the Bear and the Crescent now tighten a vise on Austria, and Britannia rules the waves, setting the board for an explosive autumn.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in Italy's core regions by establishing control over key supply centers such as Trieste, Venice, and Rome, while preparing to challenge Austria and France for nearby centers.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to coordinate early expansion into the Western Mediterranean and potentially isolate Austria and Germany, while maintaining flexibility to shift alliances if necessary.
- Monitor Turkey and Russia closely, avoiding early conflicts with them, but prepare to exploit any overextension or weakness in their positions to gain additional supply centers.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates as England’s twin fleets spearhead into the North Sea and Yorkshire while Germany scoops up Denmark, leaving France nervously turtled on its coasts. In the east, Russia drives a bayonet into Austria by slipping into Galicia, and Turkey doubles down with the Black Sea–Bulgaria one-two punch that slams the door on Vienna’s southern lifeline. Sensing weakness, Italy lunges for Trieste but is met by a wild three-way pile-up that strands every Austrian unit and exposes the Habsburgs as isolated and out of sync. No centers fall—yet—but the Bear and the Crescent now tighten a vise on Austria, and Britannia rules the waves, setting the board for an explosive autumn.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand into neighboring supply centers, particularly focusing on consolidating control of Germany's core regions (Berlin, Kiel, Munich) and establishing a foothold in the Low Countries and Scandinavia.
- Form a strategic alliance with either France or Russia to counterbalance the United Kingdom and Austria, aiming to avoid early conflicts and secure a stable front for expansion.
- Prepare for a potential eastern or western front by positioning units to either support an attack into France or Russia, depending on diplomatic developments, while maintaining flexibility to shift alliances.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles
    - Paris

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and secure key centers to build toward domination. Currently, Turkey controls Ankara, Constantinople, and Smyrna, with Bulgaria and Rumelia (Rumania) still uncontrolled. Our fleet in Black Sea (BLA) is well-positioned to threaten or support moves into Bulgaria and Rumania, while our army in Smyrna can support or attack neighboring territories.

Given the current map and options, I see an opportunity to push into Bulgaria and Rumania to secure those centers quickly, while maintaining a defensive stance against Austria and other powers. Our main threats are Austria to the northwest and potential Russian or Italian moves. Russia is friendly, so we can coordinate with them to contain Austria.

In this phase, I will:

- Support Bulgaria (A BUL) to hold or move into Rumania, aiming to secure both.
- Use the fleet in Black Sea to threaten Rumania (F BLA - RUM) or support Bulgaria.
- Keep Smyrna flexible to support either Bulgaria or Rumania, or defend against potential threats.
- Avoid overextending into Austria or Italy for now, focusing on consolidating Balkan gains.

This move set aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumania early, setting up for further expansion into Austria's weak positions and the Balkans.

**Orders:**

- Support A BUL to hold or move into RUM (A BUL S F BLA - RUM)
- Support A SMY to hold (A SMY H) to maintain flexibility
- Fleet in Black Sea (F BLA) to support Bulgaria or Rumania as needed
- Army in Smyrna (A SMY) to hold, ready to support or move as needed

**Final Orders:**

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Austria this turn, indicating a cautious or reserved stance. Relationships remain hostile with England, France, and Germany, while Italy, Russia, and Turkey are neutral. Austria's units are positioned defensively in Budapest, Vienna, and Trieste, with no recent diplomatic breakthroughs or threats. The game state suggests a need to reassess alliances and potential expansion opportunities.

[S1901M] I ordered A VIE to support TRI to strengthen the Italian front, A BUD to move into TRI for expansion in the Balkans, and F TRI to VEN to secure Italy and prepare for potential expansion or defense.

[F1901M] No messages involving Austria this turn, indicating a focus on defensive positioning and potential strategic silence. Relationships remain hostile with Russia, Turkey, Germany, France, and Italy, with no new agreements or alliances established. The game state shows Austria maintaining its core centers but facing multiple threats from neighbors.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively while defending key centers in the east and south. Given the current map and hostile relationships with Russia, Turkey, Italy, Germany, France, and England, I need to focus on consolidating my position in the Balkans and preparing for expansion into unclaimed centers.

- I will support my units in Vienna and Trieste to maintain control and prepare for future offensives.
- Moving A BUD to TRI is a bold move to threaten Italy's supply centers and potentially cut off their expansion.
- Moving A VIE to GAL is a strategic attempt to threaten Russia's eastern flank and possibly gain control of Galicia.
- F TRI will hold to support the army in Trieste or to prepare for future moves.
- I will also consider supporting A GAL from VIE if needed, but for now, I will hold.

This aggressive stance aims to push into Italy and Russia, exploiting their potential overextension, while maintaining a defensive posture in Vienna and Budapest.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A VIE - GAL (supporting VIE to GAL to threaten Russia)
- A VIE - GAL (to threaten Russia's eastern flank)
- A TRI S A VEN - TRI (supporting the move into Trieste to threaten Italy)
- F TRI - VEN (to threaten Italy's supply centers and support the attack)
- A VEN - TRI (to push into Italy's territory, supported by F TRI)

This plan aims to threaten Italy and Russia simultaneously, setting up for expansion in the Balkans and Italy.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with France, emphasizing cooperation in Western Europe and mutual containment of Germany. Germany remains hostile, with no response to recent messages, indicating potential hostility or disinterest. Russia and Turkey are neutral, monitoring the situation without active engagement. Austria remains an enemy, focused on their own expansion. No new agreements were reached this turn, but the overall diplomatic environment remains stable with France and Russia as key players.

[S1901M] England is moving the fleet from Edinburgh to the North Sea and the fleet from London to the Yorkshire coast, while the army from Liverpool is also heading to Yorkshire. These moves aim to secure control over the North Sea and English Channel, establishing dominance in Western Europe and preparing for future expansion and alliance strategies.

[F1901M] Maintained friendly relations with France, reinforcing the alliance and coordinating on Western Europe. Germany remains unfriendly, with ongoing tensions over North Sea and Denmark. Russia is unfriendly, monitoring Galicia and Eastern Europe. Turkey remains neutral, open to diplomatic engagement. Italy is neutral, observing developments. No new agreements reached this turn, but diplomatic channels remain open with key players.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand and secure supply centers, especially in the North Sea, English Channel, and potentially into Scandinavia or Belgium. Our current position with fleets in North Sea, YOR, and London, plus the army in Liverpool, provides a strong foundation for aggressive expansion in the northwest and west.

- I will move the fleet from North Sea to the Norwegian Sea (NWY) to threaten Scandinavia and prepare for future expansion into Sweden or support moves into the North Atlantic.
- The fleet in YOR will support the move from North Sea to the Norwegian Sea, reinforcing our push into Scandinavia.
- The fleet in London will move to the English Channel to threaten France and secure our western flank.
- The army in Liverpool will move to Yorkshire to support the fleet's move into NWY or prepare for a future attack into Belgium or France.

This setup aims to threaten Scandinavia, pressure France, and maintain control of the North Sea and English Channel, setting the stage for further expansion in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- F NTH S F DEN - NWY (support move into NWY, threatening Scandinavia)
- F YOR S F NTH - NWY (support move into NWY, reinforcing Scandinavian threat)
- F LON - ECH (move fleet to English Channel to threaten France and control the western flank)
- A LVP - YOR (advance army into Yorkshire to support expansion and threaten Belgium or France later)

This aggressive stance aims to secure key strategic positions, threaten Scandinavia, and prepare for further expansion, aligning with our goal of world domination.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is RUSSIA. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: RUSSIA
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Defend Warsaw against German pressure, possibly by moving units to support or reposition.
- Secure Rumania (RUM) to expand influence in the Balkans and strengthen eastern front.
- Exploit Austria's weakness by pushing into Galicia and potentially taking Budapest if opportunity arises.
- Monitor and counter Turkish moves in the Black Sea and Bulgaria.
- Maintain flexibility to respond to German expansion into Denmark and other northern threats.
- Seek diplomatic opportunities to form temporary alliances or non-aggression pacts with France or Italy to focus on eastern and northern threats.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Unfriendly
- FRANCE: Neutral
- GERMANY: Unfriendly
- ITALY: Neutral
- TURKEY: Enemy

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Russia this turn, indicating a possible focus on internal planning or strategic silence. Relationships remain hostile with Turkey, unfriendly with Austria and England, neutral with France and Germany. Current units are positioned for expansion in the East and Balkans, with a focus on securing RUM, BUL, and potentially BLA or CON. No formal agreements or shifts in alliances have been made this turn.

[S1901M] I ordered A MOS to LVN to secure the southern flank and support expansion into the Balkans. A WAR is moving to GAL to threaten the Western front and create pressure on Germany. A MOS is supporting A WAR to Ukraine to strengthen the eastern position. F SEV and F STP/SC are holding to maintain control over key naval positions and deny access to the Baltic and Black Sea, respectively, while I prepare for further expansion in Eastern Europe and Balkan regions.

[F1901M] Maintained a cautious stance with Austria and England, recognizing their hostility and focusing on defending Warsaw and expanding in the Balkans. No new agreements were reached this turn, but the focus remains on exploiting Austria's weakness and countering German northern expansion. Turkey remains hostile, and Italy's position is neutral but potentially opportunistic. Russia's communication has been consistent, emphasizing strategic defense and expansion goals.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the East and Balkans, while also exploiting Austria's weakness and countering German northern expansion. Currently, our units are positioned to threaten key centers and support our expansion plans.

- The Army in Galicia (A GAL) is well-placed to push into Rumania (RUM) or support the attack on Budapest (BUD). Since Austria is unfriendly and controls BUD and VIE, we should aim to take BUD to weaken Austria further.
- The Army in Moscow (A MOS) can support the attack on Rumania or move to Ukraine (UKR) to threaten Austria and Turkey.
- The Fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV) can support the Black Sea or move to RUM to threaten Austria's supply centers.
- The Fleet in St. Petersburg (F STP/SC) is holding, but can support the Black Sea or move to the Baltic if needed.

Given the options, the best move is to push A GAL into BUD to threaten Austria's key center, while supporting A MOS to Ukraine to threaten Austria and Turkey. F SEV should support the Black Sea to RUM to threaten Austria's supply centers further.

**Orders:**

- A GAL S A BUD - VIE (supporting BUD attack from GAL, aiming to take BUD)
- A MOS S A UKR (supporting Ukraine from MOS, pressuring Austria and Turkey)
- F SEV S F BLA - RUM (supporting Black Sea to RUM, threatening Austria's RUM)
- F STP/SC Hold (maintain naval position, deny access to Baltic)

This aggressive stance aims to weaken Austria, expand into BUD and RUM, and prepare for further expansion into the Balkans and Eastern Europe.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

[S1901M] Germany maintains a defensive stance with Austria and Italy, while attempting to establish a more neutral or cooperative relationship with France. No direct messages from England or Russia this turn, indicating possible disengagement or strategic silence. The focus remains on consolidating core positions and preparing for potential expansion into the Low Countries and Scandinavia.

[S1901M] Germany is moving F KIE to DEN to secure Scandinavia, and A BER to PRU to threaten the Baltic. A MUN is ordered to SIL to expand eastward, supported by A BER. Both A MUN and A BER are on hold, maintaining flexibility for future actions. The focus is on consolidating Germany's core regions and preparing for potential expansion into Scandinavia and the Baltic, while keeping diplomatic options open.

[F1901M] Germany has maintained a defensive stance with units in Berlin, Munich, and Denmark, with no new agreements or messages from other powers.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively into Scandinavia and the Low Countries to secure new supply centers and weaken potential enemies. Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are the most accessible early targets, especially since they are neutral and close to my borders. Securing DEN will give me a foothold in Scandinavia, and taking HOL will threaten England and open up further expansion into the North Sea.

I will move F DEN to NTH to threaten the English Channel and prepare for future moves into Scandinavia or the North Sea. I will support F DEN to NTH with F DEN to HEL to ensure control of the North Sea and deny England easy access.

In the west, I will move A MUN to KIE to threaten the Low Countries and prepare for expansion into Belgium or the Netherlands. Supporting A MUN to KIE will help secure the region and set up future moves.

I will hold A BER for now, maintaining flexibility and defending my core. Moving A BER to PRU is an option for future expansion, but I want to keep options open.

I will also support A MUN to SIL to threaten the Baltic and keep Russian options in check, while supporting A MUN to KIE to secure the Low Countries.

[S1901M] Italy has established a friendly relationship with France, focusing on potential cooperation in the Western Mediterranean. No direct agreements have been finalized, but the tone remains cooperative. Austria and Russia are perceived as unfriendly, with no active negotiations. Germany and England remain neutral, with no recent communication. Turkey is also unfriendly, but no negotiations are ongoing. Italy's units are positioned defensively in NAP, ROM, and VEN, with a focus on consolidating core centers.

[S1901M] I am moving A VEN to TRI to secure Trieste, while holding A ROM and F NAP to defend Italy's core regions. This setup aims to strengthen Italy's position in the south and prepare for future expansion and alliance opportunities.

[F1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, aiming to coordinate expansion into the Western Mediterranean and isolate Austria. Austria is considered an enemy, with ongoing threats in the region. Russia and Turkey are viewed as enemies, with no recent communication.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's primary focus this turn is to capitalize on Austria's weakened position by securing Trieste, Venice, and Rome, which are critical supply centers. Our units are well-positioned: the army in Naples (NAP), the army in Rome (ROM), and the army in Venice (VEN).

- The move to support the attack on Trieste is essential, as Austria is our enemy and controlling Trieste will significantly weaken their hold in the region.
- Moving A VEN to TRI with support from A APU and F ION will help us take Trieste, especially since Austria's F TRI is a threat but can be overwhelmed with coordinated support.
- The army in Rome (ROM) will hold to defend the core, but I will also prepare to support future expansion into other Italian or Balkan centers.
- The fleet in NAP will move to TYS to defend against French or other threats, and to maintain naval flexibility.
- The units are supported to maximize the chance of success in taking Trieste, which is vital for our expansion.

This aggressive move aims to weaken Austria further and set the stage for future expansion into the Balkans and the Mediterranean.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom—Austria blows the doors off F1901 by shoving Vienna and Budapest into Galicia, booting Russia’s lone forward army and turning yesterday’s dance partners into sworn enemies! Germany revs up next, yanking Munich to Kiel and sliding its Danish fleet into the Helgoland Bight, a clear signal that the Kaiser wants a piece of the northern pie while England’s Lvp-to-Yorkshire dash is stone-walled and France cool-boxes the Channel. In the south, Italy and Austria clash to a bruising Trieste–Venice bounce, and the much-hyped Russo-Turkish push on Rumania fizzles in a sea of voided supports, leaving the Black Sea and Sevastopol crews grinding their teeth. No centers flip yet, but with the Tsar reeling, the Archduke ascendant, and every frontier crackling with tension, the coming winter builds promise fireworks!

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom—Austria blows the doors off F1901 by shoving Vienna and Budapest into Galicia, booting Russia’s lone forward army and turning yesterday’s dance partners into sworn enemies! Germany revs up next, yanking Munich to Kiel and sliding its Danish fleet into the Helgoland Bight, a clear signal that the Kaiser wants a piece of the northern pie while England’s Lvp-to-Yorkshire dash is stone-walled and France cool-boxes the Channel. In the south, Italy and Austria clash to a bruising Trieste–Venice bounce, and the much-hyped Russo-Turkish push on Rumania fizzles in a sea of voided supports, leaving the Black Sea and Sevastopol crews grinding their teeth. No centers flip yet, but with the Tsar reeling, the Archduke ascendant, and every frontier crackling with tension, the coming winter builds promise fireworks!

- Maintain neutrality with Italy while observing their future intentions.
- Engage diplomatically with Turkey to assess their intentions and potential for cooperation.
- Secure and expand control over the North Sea and English Channel to establish dominance in Western Europe.

Boom—Austria blows the doors off F1901 by shoving Vienna and Budapest into Galicia, booting Russia’s lone forward army and turning yesterday’s dance partners into sworn enemies! Germany revs up next, yanking Munich to Kiel and sliding its Danish fleet into the Helgoland Bight, a clear signal that the Kaiser wants a piece of the northern pie while England’s Lvp-to-Yorkshire dash is stone-walled and France cool-boxes the Channel.

No centers flip yet, but with the Tsar reeling, the Archduke ascendant, and every frontier crackling with tension, the coming winter builds promise fireworks!

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom—Austria blows the doors off F1901 by shoving Vienna and Budapest into Galicia, booting Russia’s lone forward army and turning yesterday’s dance partners into sworn enemies! Germany revs up next, yanking Munich to Kiel and sliding its Danish fleet into the Helgoland Bight, a clear signal that the Kaiser wants a piece of the northern pie while England’s Lvp-to-Yorkshire dash is stone-walled and France cool-boxes the Channel. In the south, Italy and Austria clash to a bruising Trieste–Venice bounce, and the much-hyped Russo-Turkish push on Rumania fizzles in a sea of voided supports, leaving the Black Sea and Sevastopol crews grinding their teeth. No centers flip yet, but with the Tsar reeling, the Archduke ascendant, and every frontier crackling with tension, the coming winter builds promise fireworks!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Capitalize on Austria's weakened position by securing Trieste, Venice, and Rome.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to coordinate expansion into the Western Mediterranean and isolate Austria.
- Monitor Russia and Turkey for opportunities to expand into their overextended or vulnerable positions.
- Prepare to challenge Austria further and secure additional centers in Italy and the surrounding regions.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901R,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Russia this turn, indicating a possible focus on internal planning or strategic silence. Relationships remain hostile with Turkey, unfriendly with Austria and England, neutral with France and Germany. Current units are positioned for expansion in the East and Balkans, with a focus on securing RUM, BUL, and potentially BLA or CON. No formal agreements or shifts in alliances have been made this turn.

[S1901M] I ordered A MOS to LVN to secure the southern flank and support expansion into the Balkans. A WAR is moving to GAL to threaten the Western front and create pressure on Germany. A MOS is supporting A WAR to Ukraine to strengthen the eastern position. F SEV and F STP/SC are holding to maintain control over key naval positions and deny access to the Baltic and Black Sea, respectively, while I prepare for further expansion in Eastern Europe and Balkan regions.

[F1901M] Maintained a cautious stance with Austria and England, recognizing their hostility and focusing on defending Warsaw and expanding in the Balkans. No new agreements were reached this turn, but the focus remains on exploiting Austria's weakness and countering German northern expansion. Turkey remains hostile, and Italy's position is neutral but potentially opportunistic. Russia's communication has been consistent, emphasizing strategic defense and expansion goals.

[F1901M] Russia orders to support Galicia from BUD to VIE, convoy SEV to RUM, hold STP/SC, and hold MOS. The strategy focuses on defending Warsaw, expanding into Rumania, and exploiting Austria's weakness, while maintaining flexibility against German and Turkish threats.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and Balkans, exploiting Austria's weakness and positioning for future attacks on their remaining centers. We should also prepare for potential German pressure in the north, but our main focus remains on consolidating control over Rumania and the Balkans, which are critical for reaching 18 centers.

In this phase, I will:
- Support Galicia from BUD to VIE to reinforce our hold on the region and prepare for further expansion.
- Convoy SEV to RUM to secure Rumania, which is a key target for expansion.
- Hold STP/SC and MOS to maintain control and flexibility.
- Consider moving A GAL R WAR to threaten Austria's BUD and GAL, applying pressure on Austria's eastern front.
- Prepare to support or reposition units based on Austria's response and German movements.

This approach aims to secure Rumania early, push into Austria's Galicia, and keep options open for future attacks on Budapest or further Balkan expansion.

**Orders:**
- Support Galicia from BUD to VIE
- Convoy SEV to RUM
- Hold STP/SC
- Hold MOS
- Move A GAL R WAR

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901R):
The only piece left twisting in the autumn wind was Russia’s Galician army, and—boom!—it juked west into Bohemia, turning a bruising retreat into a frontline thrust at the heart of Central Europe. Instantly every Viennese, Munich, and Berlin war room lit up: the Bear now straddles the German-Austrian fault line! No centers changed hands this round, but the balance of fear just did, and the board is suddenly primed for a winter of paranoia and pre-emptive backstabs.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901R):
The only piece left twisting in the autumn wind was Russia’s Galician army, and—boom!—it juked west into Bohemia, turning a bruising retreat into a frontline thrust at the heart of Central Europe. Instantly every Viennese, Munich, and Berlin war room lit up: the Bear now straddles the German-Austrian fault line! No centers changed hands this round, but the balance of fear just did, and the board is suddenly primed for a winter of paranoia and pre-emptive backstabs.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure Trieste, Venice, and Rome to capitalize on Austria's weakened position.
- Strengthen alliance with France to coordinate expansion into the Western Mediterranean and isolate Austria.
- Monitor Russia for opportunities to expand into Rumania and the Black Sea.
- Prepare to challenge Austria further and seek additional centers in Italy and the surrounding regions.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, emphasizing cooperation in the Balkans and Black Sea. No new agreements with Austria, Italy, or Western powers; their hostility persists. England and France remain unresponsive, limiting diplomatic options. No messages from Germany, indicating possible strategic silence or disinterest.

[S1901M] Moved fleet from Ankara to Black Sea to threaten the Balkans and secure a strategic position; ordered Army in Constantinople to hold, aiming to strengthen control over Anatolia and prepare for expansion.

[F1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Russia, focusing on securing Bulgaria and Rumania, while Austria remains an enemy and is likely to be targeted for pressure or attack. England, France, Germany, and Italy are all unfriendly, with no recent responses, indicating a lack of engagement or possible hostility. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn.

[F1901M] I ordered A BUL to support F BLA moving to RUM, and F BLA to support A BUL moving to RUM, aiming to secure Bulgaria and Rumania. I also held A SMY in place to maintain Balkan pressure. The strategy focuses on consolidating Balkan positions, containing Austria, and preparing for further expansion into the Balkans and Anatolia.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and secure key centers to reach 18 supply centers. Currently, Turkey controls Ankara, Constantinople, Smyrna, and Bulgaria. We should aim to consolidate our hold on Bulgaria and Rumania, push into Greece, and threaten Austria's holdings in Trieste and Vienna.

Given the current map, I will focus on:
- Supporting the move of Bulgaria into Rumania to secure that position.
- Moving Smyrna to Greece to threaten Greece and potentially gain a new supply center.
- Maintaining a strong Black Sea presence to threaten Austria and Russia.
- Preparing for future expansion into Austria's Trieste and Vienna, and possibly into Italy or further into the Balkans.

Since Russia is friendly, I will coordinate with them to contain Austria and possibly support their expansion into Galicia or Ukraine if opportunities arise. Austria is an enemy, so I will pressure their positions.

Orders:
- Support Bulgaria to move into Rumania.
- Move Smyrna to Greece to threaten Greece.
- Keep Black Sea fleet in position to threaten Austria and support Russia if needed.
- Hold Ankara and Constantinople to maintain a strong defensive line.

**Orders:**
- A BUL S A BUD - RUM (support Bulgaria into Rumania)
- A SMY - GRE (attack Greece)
- F BLA - BLA (hold Black Sea fleet)
- A CON - BUL (advance into Bulgaria to threaten Austria)
- F SEV - BLA (support Black Sea fleet to hold position)

This aggressive stance aims to secure the Balkans, threaten Austria's centers, and position for further expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Russia roars out of 1901 on top, shock-parking an army in Bohemia that now menaces both Vienna and Munich and hints at either a ruthless stab or a daring western crusade. Turkey is the lone climber, pocketing Bulgaria and thundering an extra army onto the board in Ankara—yet their attempted second build in Constantinople mis-queues, a fumble that could stall the Sultan’s momentum before it even starts. England, France and Germany circle like wary sharks, fleets churning from Heligoland to the North Sea while Austria braces in Galicia and Italy’s Tyrrhenian squadron eyes the French coast. The powder keg is packed; one misplaced step in 1902 could see Russia crack the west or Turkey rebound for an explosive counter-surge!

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Russia roars out of 1901 on top, shock-parking an army in Bohemia that now menaces both Vienna and Munich and hints at either a ruthless stab or a daring western crusade. Turkey is the lone climber, pocketing Bulgaria and thundering an extra army onto the board in Ankara—yet their attempted second build in Constantinople mis-queues, a fumble that could stall the Sultan’s momentum before it even starts. England, France and Germany circle like wary sharks, fleets churning from Heligoland to the North Sea while Austria braces in Galicia and Italy’s Tyrrhenian squadron eyes the French coast. The powder keg is packed; one misplaced step in 1902 could see Russia crack the west or Turkey rebound for an explosive counter-surge!

CURRENT STATUS

- Reinforce Vienna and Galicia to withstand Russian and Turkish pressure
- Engage diplomatically with Italy and Turkey to form temporary alliances or understandings against Germany and Russia
- Prepare to counter-attack or defend against Russian advances into Central Europe

Austria is now under threat from both Russia and Turkey, prompting a defensive posture. Italy remains neutral, observing the chaos in the east and west."",

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Russia roars out of 1901 on top, shock-parking an army in Bohemia that now menaces both Vienna and Munich and hints at either a ruthless stab or a daring western crusade. Turkey is the lone climber, pocketing Bulgaria and thundering an extra army onto the board in Ankara—yet their attempted second build in Constantinople mis-queues, a fumble that could stall the Sultan’s momentum before it even starts. England, France and Germany circle like wary sharks, fleets churning from Heligoland to the North Sea while Austria braces in Galicia and Italy’s Tyrrhenian squadron eyes the French coast. The powder keg is packed; one misplaced step in 1902 could see Russia crack the west or Turkey rebound for an explosive counter-surge!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Reinforce and defend Warsaw against German pressure, possibly by repositioning units or supporting moves.
- Prepare to push into Galicia and consider an attack on Budapest if the opportunity arises.
- Monitor German expansion into Kiel and Helgoland Bight, and support or reposition fleets and armies accordingly.
- Seek diplomatic opportunities to form non-aggression pacts with France or Italy to focus on eastern and northern threats.
- Exploit Austria's weakness by threatening their centers and positioning for future offensives.

}

4. As England, after a failed attack on Belgium (BEL) which was occupied by France, supported by Germany. Russia moved into Sweden (SWE) uncontested. Austria and Italy skirmished over Trieste (TRI). Turkey was quiet.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""My attack on Belgium was decisively repulsed due to Franco-German cooperation, marking them as a significant threat bloc. Russia's acquisition of Sweden is concerning for my northern position. The Austro-Italian conflict seems localized for now, and Turkey's inactivity makes them an unknown variable, potentially open to diplomacy."",

5. As Russia, after successfully negotiating passage through Black Sea (BLA) with Turkey to take Rumania (RUM). Germany moved into Silesia (SIL), threatening Warsaw (WAR). Austria and France exchanged hostile messages but made no direct moves against each other. England built a new fleet in London (LON). Italy seems focused west.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""Securing Rumania via Turkish agreement is a major success. This improves my southern position and Turkey is now a provisional ally. Germany's move into Silesia is a direct and immediate threat to Warsaw; they are now my primary adversary. Austria and France are posturing, but their conflict doesn't directly affect me yet, keeping them neutral. England's new fleet is a long-term concern but not immediate. Italy's westward focus means they are not a current threat or priority."",

  ""reasoning"": ""Russia's armies in Bohemia and the threat to Vienna and Munich indicate an aggressive stance towards Central Europe, especially Germany. The presence of Russian units near Austria's borders and the potential for a western crusade suggest a shift from cautious to more assertive expansion. Turkey's successful gain in Bulgaria and the buildup in Ankara show an active but somewhat unstable position, with a mis-queued build in Constantinople hinting at possible delays. Austria remains a primary enemy, given their position in Galicia and the threat to Warsaw. Germany's expansion into Kiel and Helgoland Bight is a concern, but Russia's focus appears to be on the east and central Europe. England, France, and Italy are circling, but no immediate threats are evident from them, though their positions warrant caution. The overall situation favors a strategy of leveraging the eastern and central European positions to push for more centers, while monitoring and possibly exploiting Austria's weakness and German overreach."",
