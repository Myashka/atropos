atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Goals:**
  1. **Secure control of the North Sea:** This is crucial for England to maintain naval superiority and protect its home centers. The North Sea is a strategic location that allows for flexibility in both defense and offense.
  2. **Expand into neutral supply centers:** Norway and Belgium are key targets for early expansion. They are relatively accessible and can be secured with minimal conflict if diplomatic relations are managed well.
  3. **Establish a strong alliance:** Forming an alliance with either France or Germany can help secure England's position in the west, allowing for a focus on expansion elsewhere. This decision should be based on early diplomatic interactions and perceived threats.

- **Initial Relationships:**
  - All relationships are marked as ""Neutral"" at the start. This reflects the need for England to engage in diplomacy and gather more information before committing to any alliances or conflicts. The early game is about feeling out the intentions of other players and positioning England advantageously.",Success: Applied LLM data

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Greetings from England! I propose we consider a non-aggression pact for the early game. This would allow us both to focus on expansion rather than conflict. I am interested in moving towards Norway and Belgium, and I have no intentions on the English Channel. Let me know your thoughts.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hi France, I wanted to reach out to discuss our positions. While I understand we may have some tensions, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to avoid conflict in the early game. Perhaps we can agree to focus on our respective expansions without stepping on each other's toes?

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ITALY: Hello! I wanted to touch base and ensure peaceful relations between our nations. I am focusing on securing Tunis and have no aggressive intentions towards France. Perhaps we can discuss potential cooperation in the future?

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.

MESSAGES THIS ROUND
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 AUSTRIA: As Austria, I am looking to expand my influence in the Balkans and secure key supply centers. I welcome any discussions with other powers to ensure a balanced approach in our diplomatic relations.
 GERMANY: To all powers, I am looking forward to a productive game. Germany is committed to a strong and stable Europe, and I hope we can all find ways to collaborate for mutual benefit.
 TURKEY: To all powers: As we embark on this new phase, I am looking forward to a fair and strategic game. I believe that cooperation and understanding will lead us to a more prosperous outcome for all involved.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Greetings from England! I propose we consider a non-aggression pact for the early game. This would allow us both to focus on expansion rather than conflict. I am interested in moving towards Norway and Belgium, and I have no intentions on the English Channel. Let me know your thoughts.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hi France, I wanted to reach out to discuss our positions. While I understand we may have some tensions, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to avoid conflict in the early game. Perhaps we can agree to focus on our respective expansions without stepping on each other's toes?

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ITALY: Hello! I wanted to touch base and ensure peaceful relations between our nations. I am focusing on securing Tunis and have no aggressive intentions towards France. Perhaps we can discuss potential cooperation in the future?
END MESSAGES

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Rumania (RUM) and Serbia (SER) early in the game to expand my supply centers.
- I have established a friendly dialogue with Italy, and I want to maintain that alliance while also being cautious of Germany and Russia, who are both unfriendly.
- I will move my army from Budapest (BUD) to Rumania (RUM) to secure that supply center, as it is unoccupied and a key target.
- I will also move my army from Vienna (VIE) to Serbia (SER) to secure that supply center as well. This move is supported by my fleet in Trieste (TRI), which can support the move to Serbia.
- The fleet in Trieste will hold its position for now, as it is strategically important for future moves into the Adriatic Sea and to support any potential moves towards Venice or Albania.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is seeking to establish a strong alliance with Austria to counter Russian influence and secure the Balkans. England has proposed a mutually beneficial alliance focusing on the North Sea, while France has not responded to Germany's outreach for a non-aggression pact. Italy's response is also pending, but Germany sees potential for cooperation. Russia has proposed a non-aggression pact for the north, which Germany is considering. Overall, there is a mix of potential alliances and some silence from key players, indicating a cautious start to the game.

  GERMANY: Hi France, I wanted to reach out to discuss our positions. While I understand we may have some tensions, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to avoid conflict in the early game. Perhaps we can agree to focus on our respective expansions without stepping on each other's toes?

 Conversation with ITALY:
  GERMANY: Greetings Italy, I see potential for cooperation between us. If we can align our interests, we could both benefit from a stable Mediterranean. I would love to hear your thoughts on how we can work together.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  RUSSIA: Greetings! I propose we establish a non-aggression pact for the north. I will focus on securing Sweden, and I suggest we coordinate to contain England's expansion. Let me know your thoughts.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Denmark (DEN) and Belgium (BEL) as they are crucial for early expansion and will strengthen my position in Northern Europe.
- The fleet in Kiel (KIE) is well-positioned to move to Denmark, while the army in Berlin (BER) can support the move to Munich (MUN) or move towards Prussia (PRU) to potentially threaten Warsaw (WAR) if the opportunity arises.
- The army in Munich (MUN) will hold to protect against any potential French aggression while also being able to support moves towards Belgium or the Ruhr.
- I will also maintain a friendly stance with Austria and England to ensure that I can focus on my expansion without immediate threats from those powers.

gpt-4o-mini,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: Greetings from England! I propose we consider a non-aggression pact for the early game. This would allow us both to focus on expansion rather than conflict. I am interested in moving towards Norway and Belgium, and I have no intentions on the English Channel. Let me know your thoughts.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: Hello Germany! I believe a strong alliance between us could be mutually beneficial. I am planning to focus on the North Sea and Norway, and I have no designs on Denmark or Holland at this time. Let's work together to ensure a stable western front. What are your thoughts?

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  ENGLAND: Greetings Russia! I wanted to touch base regarding our mutual interests in the north. I am planning to move towards Norway and would like to avoid any early conflicts. Perhaps we can discuss a demilitarized zone in the Barents Sea to ensure peace between us?
  RUSSIA: Hi there! I am interested in maintaining a peaceful relationship in the north. I will be focusing on securing Sweden and have no intentions against Norway. Let's keep the lines of communication open.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As England, my primary goal in the Spring 1901 move phase is to secure a strong position in the North Sea and begin expanding into neutral supply centers. Given the current diplomatic situation, with France and Germany being unfriendly, I need to ensure my naval dominance and prepare for potential conflicts. Russia has expressed a willingness to maintain peace in the north, which allows me to focus on securing Norway and potentially Belgium.

1. **F EDI - NTH**: Moving the fleet from Edinburgh to the North Sea is crucial for establishing naval dominance. This move positions me to support future operations into Norway or Belgium and protects against any potential aggression from France or Germany.

2. **F LON - ENG**: Moving the fleet from London to the English Channel serves multiple purposes. It allows me to exert pressure on France, potentially deterring any aggressive moves from them, and positions me to support a move into Belgium in the fall.

3. **A LVP - YOR**: Moving the army from Liverpool to Yorkshire is a preparatory move. It positions the army to be convoyed to Norway in the fall, should the opportunity arise, or to support operations in Belgium.

These moves align with my strategic goals of securing the North Sea, preparing for expansion into neutral supply centers, and maintaining flexibility to respond to the actions of France and Germany.

gpt-4o,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

As Italy in Spring 1901, my primary goal is to secure Tunis, a neutral supply center, which will strengthen my position in the Mediterranean. This aligns with the strategic principle of proactive expansion. Additionally, maintaining a friendly relationship with Austria is crucial to ensure mutual security and avoid early conflict on the Italian-Austrian border. Given the current diplomatic landscape, I will focus on positioning my units for future expansion while ensuring my home centers are secure.

1. **Fleet in Naples (F NAP):** The fleet will move to the Ionian Sea (ION) to position itself for a move to Tunis in the fall. This move is essential for securing the Tunis supply center.

2. **Army in Rome (A ROM):** The army will move to Apulia (APU). This move positions the army to support future operations in the Balkans or southern France, depending on how diplomatic relations evolve.

3. **Army in Venice (A VEN):** The army will hold in Venice. This decision is based on maintaining a defensive posture against any potential Austrian aggression, despite our current friendly relations. It also allows flexibility for future moves into Tyrolia or Trieste if the situation changes.

gpt-4o,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Greetings Russia! I wanted to touch base regarding our mutual interests in the north. I am planning to move towards Norway and would like to avoid any early conflicts. Perhaps we can discuss a demilitarized zone in the Barents Sea to ensure peace between us?

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Russia in Spring 1901, my primary goal is to secure neutral supply centers and establish a strong position for future expansion. The key centers to focus on are Sweden in the north and Rumania in the south.

1. **Northern Strategy:**
   - **Fleet in St. Petersburg (F STP/SC):** Move to the Gulf of Bothnia (GOB) to position for a potential move into Sweden in the fall. This move is non-aggressive towards England, aligning with our peaceful intentions in the north.
   - **Army in Moscow (A MOS):** Move to Ukraine (UKR) to support a future move into Rumania and to maintain flexibility in the south.

2. **Southern Strategy:**
   - **Fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV):** Move to the Black Sea (BLA) to secure a strategic position against Turkey. This move is crucial to prevent Turkey from gaining an advantage in the Black Sea and to support future operations in the Balkans.
   - **Army in Warsaw (A WAR):** Move to Galicia (GAL) to apply pressure on Austria and to support potential future operations in the Balkans. This move also provides flexibility to support either a defensive or offensive strategy depending on Austria's actions.

These moves aim to secure key positions and supply centers while maintaining diplomatic flexibility with other powers.

Spring 1901 explodes out of the gate as England pulls a double-barrelled coup, planting fleets in BOTH the North Sea and the English Channel, instantly menacing Germany and France at once! In the east, the Black Sea erupts in foam—Russia’s Sevastopol fleet and Turkey’s Ankara armada slam to a stand-off, while Austria slips a knife through the chaos to snatch Rumania and Germany coolly waltzes into Denmark. Italy dives into the Ionian, eyeing Balkan spoils, and France stays bunkered, suddenly looking boxed in by English sails and German steel. With Austria and Turkey each pocketing a neutral and England grabbing the maritime high ground, the board’s momentum tilts sharply toward a Central-Alliance showdown and a brewing Anglo-German collision!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 explodes out of the gate as England pulls a double-barrelled coup, planting fleets in BOTH the North Sea and the English Channel, instantly menacing Germany and France at once! In the east, the Black Sea erupts in foam—Russia’s Sevastopol fleet and Turkey’s Ankara armada slam to a stand-off, while Austria slips a knife through the chaos to snatch Rumania and Germany coolly waltzes into Denmark. Italy dives into the Ionian, eyeing Balkan spoils, and France stays bunkered, suddenly looking boxed in by English sails and German steel. With Austria and Turkey each pocketing a neutral and England grabbing the maritime high ground, the board’s momentum tilts sharply toward a Central-Alliance showdown and a brewing Anglo-German collision!

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy expressed a desire to focus on securing Tunis and not on aggressive actions towards Turkey, indicating a potential for cooperation against Austria. Russia is interested in discussing the Black Sea situation, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. Austria is looking to expand in the Balkans, which may pose a threat. Germany and France have not engaged in direct discussions with Turkey yet.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The intent is to secure the Black Sea and Bulgaria, strengthen Turkey's position in the Balkans, and prepare for potential conflict with Russia while maintaining a friendly relationship with Italy.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] France and Germany have not responded to my proposals for non-aggression and alliance, respectively. Russia is open to maintaining peace in the north and has no intentions against Norway, suggesting a potential for cooperation. Austria, Germany, and Turkey have made general statements about cooperation but no specific agreements have been reached.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Edinburgh to the North Sea and Fleet London to the English Channel to secure naval dominance and prepare for expansion. Army Liverpool moved to Yorkshire to position for potential advancement into Belgium or Norway. Current relationships with France and Germany are unfriendly, necessitating strategic positioning and potential alliances.

Power: GERMANY
Phase: F1901M

Current Goals: - Secure Belgium to strengthen control in Northern Europe.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is seeking to establish a strong alliance with Austria to counter Russian influence and secure the Balkans. England has proposed a mutually beneficial alliance focusing on the North Sea, while France has not responded to Germany's outreach for a non-aggression pact. Italy's response is also pending, but Germany sees potential for cooperation. Russia has proposed a non-aggression pact for the north, which Germany is considering. Overall, there is a mix of potential alliances and some silence from key players, indicating a cautious start to the game.

[S1901M] Germany has issued orders to move the fleet from Kiel to Denmark, support the army in Berlin to Munich, and hold the army in Munich. The intent is to secure Denmark for a stronger northern position while maintaining a defensive stance in the south.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a friendly dialogue with Austria, agreeing to focus on mutual security and expansion in different directions. Germany expressed interest in cooperation, but no specific agreements were made. France has not responded to my message, which may indicate indifference or other priorities. Turkey proposed an alliance against Austria, but I remain cautious of their intentions.

[S1901M] Moved fleet from Naples to Ionian Sea to prepare for securing Tunis. Army in Rome moved to Apulia to support future operations in the Mediterranean. Army in Venice held position to maintain a defensive stance and ensure security against potential threats from Austria or France.

[S1901M] Established a friendly dialogue with Italy, agreeing to support each other's moves in the Balkans. Germany expressed interest in a mutual alliance to counter Russian influence, while Russia seeks neutrality or support for their move into Rumania. Turkey remains neutral but is seen as a potential threat. No responses from England or France, indicating they may be focused on other relationships or strategies.

[S1901M] Austria has issued orders to advance into Rumania with the army from Budapest, while holding position in Trieste and Vienna. The goal is to secure Rumania and potentially expand influence in the Balkans, while maintaining a defensive stance against Germany.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] England is open to a peaceful northern front, proposing a demilitarized zone in the Barents Sea. Germany has not responded to the non-aggression pact proposal, which may indicate other priorities or indifference. Austria has not responded to the proposal for cooperation in the south, leaving intentions unclear. Turkey is open to negotiations regarding the Black Sea, suggesting potential for a temporary peace.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Army Moscow to Ukraine and Army Warsaw to Galicia to position for potential expansion into Rumania and to pressure Austria. Fleet Sevastopol is ordered to the Black Sea to contest Turkish control and secure a strategic position. Fleet St. Petersburg holds to maintain a defensive posture in the north. The strategic intent is to secure Rumania and the Black Sea, while maintaining flexibility for future alliances and expansion.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Established a friendly dialogue with Italy, agreeing to support each other's moves in the Balkans. Germany expressed interest in a mutual alliance to counter Russian influence, while Russia seeks neutrality or support for their move into Rumania. Turkey remains neutral but is seen as a potential threat. No responses from England or France, indicating they may be focused on other relationships or strategies.

[S1901M] Austria has issued orders to advance into Rumania with the army from Budapest, while holding position in Trieste and Vienna. The goal is to secure Rumania and potentially expand influence in the Balkans, while maintaining a defensive stance against Germany.

[F1901M] Established a friendly rapport with Italy, agreeing to coordinate efforts in the Balkans and support each other's moves. Communicated intentions with Russia regarding Rumania, seeking a non-aggression pact while expressing plans to move there. Germany and Turkey remain unfriendly, with no significant engagement from them. Italy has not responded to the last message but is currently viewed as an ally.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ITALY:
  AUSTRIA: Greetings! I fully support the idea of a strong alliance between us. Your move towards Tunis sounds promising, and I appreciate your assurance regarding Trieste. Let's coordinate our efforts in the Balkans to counter any potential threats from Turkey and Russia. I plan to secure Serbia this turn, and I would be grateful for your support in that endeavor.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello! I appreciate your proposal for mutual understanding. However, I must inform you that I am planning to move into Rumania this turn. I hope this does not conflict with your plans. If we can agree on a non-aggression pact, I would be open to discussing how we can both contain Turkey effectively.
  RUSSIA: Greetings! I noticed our interests might be overlapping in the Balkans. I propose a discussion to find a mutually beneficial arrangement regarding Rumania. Perhaps we can come to an agreement that avoids conflict and strengthens both our positions.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany is seeking to establish a strong alliance with Austria to counter Russian influence and secure the Balkans. England has proposed a mutually beneficial alliance focusing on the North Sea, while France has not responded to Germany's outreach for a non-aggression pact. Italy's response is also pending, but Germany sees potential for cooperation. Russia has proposed a non-aggression pact for the north, which Germany is considering. Overall, there is a mix of potential alliances and some silence from key players, indicating a cautious start to the game.

[S1901M] Germany has issued orders to move the fleet from Kiel to Denmark, support the army in Berlin to Munich, and hold the army in Munich. The intent is to secure Denmark for a stronger northern position while maintaining a defensive stance in the south.

[F1901M] Germany has established friendly relations with England and Austria, agreeing on a non-aggression pact with England and discussing mutual support with Russia. Italy has expressed interest in cooperation, but no concrete agreements have been made. France has not responded to any messages, indicating potential hostility. The focus is on securing Belgium and maintaining a strong position against France.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy expressed a desire to focus on securing Tunis and not on aggressive actions towards Turkey, indicating a potential for cooperation against Austria. Russia is interested in discussing the Black Sea situation, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. Austria is looking to expand in the Balkans, which may pose a threat. Germany and France have not engaged in direct discussions with Turkey yet.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The intent is to secure the Black Sea and Bulgaria, strengthen Turkey's position in the Balkans, and prepare for potential conflict with Russia while maintaining a friendly relationship with Italy.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with England about potential collaboration, though they are not directly adjacent. Italy expressed a focus on securing Tunis but is open to future collaboration against Austria. Russia proposed a temporary truce in the Black Sea, which I am considering. Overall, relationships with Italy and England are positive, while Austria remains unfriendly and Russia is an enemy.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure the Black Sea and Bulgaria early in the game, which will strengthen my position in the Balkans and allow for future expansion.
- Moving the fleet from Ankara (ANK) to the Black Sea (BLA) is essential to contest the area with Russia and potentially support an advance into Rumania (RUM) or Bulgaria (BUL).
- The army in Constantinople (CON) will support the army in Bulgaria (BUL) to ensure its safety and prepare for future moves into Rumania or Serbia.
- The army in Smyrna (SMY) will hold position to maintain control over the home center and be ready to support future moves as needed.

gpt-4o,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is ENGLAND. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: ENGLAND
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure Norway to increase supply count and strengthen northern position.
- Maintain control of the North Sea to ensure naval dominance.
- Explore diplomatic options to either ally with Germany or France to focus on the other.
- Prepare for potential hostilities from France or Germany by reinforcing naval positions.
Relationships: - FRANCE: Unfriendly
- GERMANY: Friendly
- RUSSIA: Unfriendly
- ITALY: Neutral
- AUSTRIA: Neutral
- TURKEY: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] France and Germany have not responded to my proposals for non-aggression and alliance, respectively. Russia is open to maintaining peace in the north and has no intentions against Norway, suggesting a potential for cooperation. Austria, Germany, and Turkey have made general statements about cooperation but no specific agreements have been reached.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Fleet Edinburgh to the North Sea and Fleet London to the English Channel to secure naval dominance and prepare for expansion. Army Liverpool moved to Yorkshire to position for potential advancement into Belgium or Norway. Current relationships with France and Germany are unfriendly, necessitating strategic positioning and potential alliances.

[F1901M] Germany has agreed to a non-aggression pact and is open to coordinating movements in the North Sea and Denmark. Russia has not responded to my message about maintaining peace in the north, which may indicate indifference or other priorities. France has ignored my proposal for a non-aggression pact, suggesting potential hostility or other alliances. Turkey is open to communication, but no concrete agreements have been made.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As England, my primary goal in this phase is to secure Norway and maintain control of the North Sea, while also exploring opportunities for expansion into Belgium. Given the current diplomatic landscape, with Germany being friendly and France and Russia being unfriendly, I need to be cautious of potential hostilities from France. However, I have a non-aggression pact with Germany, which allows me to focus on other fronts.

1. **Fleet in the North Sea (F NTH):** I will move the fleet to Norway (NWY) to secure this neutral supply center. This move aligns with my goal of increasing my supply count and strengthening my northern position.

2. **Fleet in the English Channel (F ENG):** I will move the fleet to Belgium (BEL). This move is aggressive and aims to capture another neutral supply center. It also positions me to potentially support future operations against France if necessary.

3. **Army in Yorkshire (A YOR):** I will move the army to London (LON) to protect my home supply center and prepare for potential future convoys or defensive actions.

These moves are designed to expand my control over supply centers while maintaining a strong defensive position against potential threats from France and Russia.

gpt-4o,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Primary Objective:** Secure Tunis as a neutral supply center. This is crucial for strengthening Italy's position in the Mediterranean and aligns with the proactive expansion strategy.

2. **Diplomatic Relations:** Maintain a friendly relationship with Austria. This is important to ensure mutual security and avoid conflicts in the Balkans. Austria has expressed a desire for cooperation, and I have assured them that I will not threaten Trieste.

3. **Unit Movements:**
   - **Fleet in Ionian Sea (F ION):** Move to Tunis to secure the supply center. This move is essential for expansion and aligns with the current focus on the Mediterranean.
   - **Army in Apulia (A APU):** Hold position. This army is currently not in a position to make a significant move without risking unnecessary conflict or overextension.
   - **Army in Venice (A VEN):** Hold position. This army serves as a defensive measure against potential threats from Austria or France. Given the current diplomatic stance with Austria, an aggressive move towards Trieste is not advisable.

4. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **Avoiding Conflict with Austria:** By not moving aggressively towards Trieste, I maintain the trust and cooperation with Austria, which is beneficial for future joint operations against Turkey or Russia.
   - **Monitoring France:** France's lack of response to my outreach suggests they may have other priorities. However, I must remain vigilant of any potential threats from the west.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] England is open to a peaceful northern front, proposing a demilitarized zone in the Barents Sea. Germany has not responded to the non-aggression pact proposal, which may indicate other priorities or indifference. Austria has not responded to the proposal for cooperation in the south, leaving intentions unclear. Turkey is open to negotiations regarding the Black Sea, suggesting potential for a temporary peace.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Army Moscow to Ukraine and Army Warsaw to Galicia to position for potential expansion into Rumania and to pressure Austria. Fleet Sevastopol is ordered to the Black Sea to contest Turkish control and secure a strategic position. Fleet St. Petersburg holds to maintain a defensive posture in the north. The strategic intent is to secure Rumania and the Black Sea, while maintaining flexibility for future alliances and expansion.

[F1901M] Austria plans to move into Rumania, which conflicts with my interests. Germany is open to a non-aggression pact and potentially supporting my move into Sweden. Turkey is open to negotiations regarding the Black Sea, suggesting a possible truce. England is interested in maintaining peace in the north, aligning with my current strategy.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello! I appreciate your proposal for mutual understanding. However, I must inform you that I am planning to move into Rumania this turn. I hope this does not conflict with your plans. If we can agree on a non-aggression pact, I would be open to discussing how we can both contain Turkey effectively.
  RUSSIA: Greetings! I noticed our interests might be overlapping in the Balkans. I propose a discussion to find a mutually beneficial arrangement regarding Rumania. Perhaps we can come to an agreement that avoids conflict and strengthens both our positions.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Hello! Thank you for your message. I am pleased to hear that you have no intentions against Norway. I am interested in maintaining peace in the north as well. Let's keep our communication open and work towards a stable northern region.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Greetings Russia! I appreciate your proposal for a non-aggression pact in the north. I believe it would be wise for us to focus on containing England's expansion together. However, I would like to keep an eye on Austria's movements as well. Let's stay in touch and coordinate our strategies.
  RUSSIA: Greetings! I appreciate your commitment to a stable Europe. I propose we solidify our friendship by supporting each other's interests. I am keen on securing Sweden and would appreciate your support in this matter. In return, I am open to supporting your strategic goals in the region. Let's work together for mutual benefit.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  RUSSIA: Hello! I agree that cooperation in the Black Sea region could be beneficial for both of us. I propose a temporary truce in the Black Sea to focus on other fronts. This could allow us to strengthen our positions without unnecessary conflict. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.
  TURKEY: Greetings, Russia. I appreciate your interest in discussing the Black Sea situation. I am open to negotiations and would like to explore how we can both benefit from a peaceful resolution. Perhaps we can agree on a mutual understanding regarding our movements in the region?

2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Strategic Goals:**
   - Secure Rumania (RUM) to expand Russian influence and gain a supply center.
   - Maintain a defensive posture in the Black Sea while negotiating a truce with Turkey.
   - Position for potential future moves against Austria or Turkey, depending on diplomatic developments.

2. **Unit Orders:**
   - **A GAL - RUM:** This move aims to capture Rumania, a critical supply center. Given Austria's intention to move into Rumania, this move is aggressive but necessary to contest control.
   - **F SEV S A GAL - RUM:** Supporting the move from Galicia to Rumania with the fleet in Sevastopol increases the chances of successfully capturing Rumania.
   - **A UKR S A GAL - RUM:** Providing additional support from Ukraine to the move into Rumania further strengthens the attempt to secure this supply center.
   - **F STP/SC H:** Holding the fleet in St. Petersburg maintains a defensive posture in the north, aligning with the current neutral stance with England and Germany.

3. **Diplomatic Considerations:**
   - Continue negotiations with Turkey to establish a truce in the Black Sea, which could allow for a focus on Austria.
   - Maintain open communication with Germany to secure support for future moves into Sweden and to counterbalance England's influence.
