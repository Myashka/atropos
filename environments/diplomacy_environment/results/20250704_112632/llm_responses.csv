intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

EXAMPLES:

Scenario 1: As France, after discussing a joint move against Germany with England, while Italy seems to be posturing aggressively in Piedmont.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in Central Europe and secure key supply centers to reach 18. We need to capitalize on the current position by taking control of unclaimed centers nearby, especially Denmark (DEN), Holland (HOL), and Belgium (BEL). Securing these will strengthen our northern flank and open pathways into Scandinavia and the Low Countries.

- Kiel (KIE) is well-positioned to move into Denmark or Holland. Moving F KIE to DEN will secure Denmark early, while supporting a move into HOL can threaten the Low Countries.
- Berlin (BER) should support MUN to expand into the East or hold to defend against Russian or French threats.
- Munich (MUN) can support MUN to SIL or move to KIE to threaten the Low Countries or support DEN.

Given the current map, I will:
- Move F KIE to DEN to secure Denmark.
- Support A MUN to SIL to push into the East or prepare for future expansion.
- Hold Berlin to maintain a strong defensive position.
- Support A BER to MUN to reinforce our central position.

This aggressive stance aims to secure early centers and prepare for further expansion into the West and East.

**Orders:**
- F KIE - DEN
- A MUN S A BER - MUN
- A BER H
- A MUN - SIL

**Note:** No support moves into Holland or Belgium this turn, but positioning F KIE to DEN is a strong first step. We will reassess next turn for further expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the North Sea and English Channel, leveraging our friendly relationship with France to contain Germany and secure key supply centers. We should aim to secure the Low Countries (Belgium, Holland, and the Netherlands) early, as they are critical for expansion and controlling access to the continent.

Given the current map and options, I will:
- Move F EDI to NTH to threaten or potentially dislodge German units, while maintaining flexibility.
- Support F LON to YOR to secure the English coast and prepare for future expansion.
- Use F LON to move to NTH, aiming to threaten or contest the German fleet in KIE.
- Use A LVP to support moves into YOR or to reposition for future expansion.
- Keep options open for future moves into Belgium or Holland, depending on German responses.

This aggressive stance will help us secure the North Sea and English Channel, and position us for rapid expansion into Belgium and the Low Countries in subsequent turns. We will also monitor German and French movements closely, ready to shift support or support holds as needed.

**Orders:**
- F EDI - NTH
- F LON - YOR
- A LVP - YOR
- F LON S F EDI - NTH
- A LVP H

**Note:** The support order for F LON S F EDI - NTH is to reinforce the move, which could threaten the German fleet in KIE or contest control of the North Sea.

*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is ITALY. The S1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: ITALY
Phase: S1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and expand in Italy's core regions: consolidate control of NAP, ROM, and VEN to strengthen early position.
- Establish a strategic stance towards neighbors: consider forming a non-aggression or limited cooperation with France and Austria to avoid early conflicts.
- Assess and prepare for potential conflicts with Turkey and Germany: monitor their movements and position units accordingly for defensive or offensive actions.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Neutral
- GERMANY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Neutral
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy has maintained a neutral stance with France and Germany, focusing on consolidating control over NAP, ROM, and VEN. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn. Austria remains unfriendly, and Turkey is unfriendly, with no direct negotiations ongoing. The silence from other powers suggests a cautious or strategic withholding of commitments.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT

   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand Italy’s control over key centers and position for a potential world domination. Currently, Italy controls NAP, ROM, and VEN, which are solid core regions. To achieve this, I need to push into neighboring supply centers, especially those that are accessible and can be taken early.

- **Focus on Austria:** Austria is unfriendly and controls TRI, BUD, and VIE. TRI is the closest and most strategic target, as it borders VEN and is a key Austrian center. Moving to take TRI will weaken Austria and open up more expansion opportunities.
- **Secure the Ionian Sea and Eastern Mediterranean:** I have units in NAP, ROM, VEN, and ION. I will use F NAP to support a move into TYS, aiming to threaten or dislodge Austria’s TRI. F ION can support the attack on TRI from the sea.
- **Defend against French and German threats:** France and Germany are neutral, but I should be cautious. Holding my current positions and supporting aggressive moves into Austria will help expand while maintaining defensive readiness.
- **Support moves:** I will support VEN into TRI to ensure success, and I will move NAP to TYS to threaten Austria’s TRI and prepare for further expansion.
- **Army in ROM:** Hold to maintain control and defend against potential Austrian or French moves.
- **Fleet in NAP:** Move to TYS to support the attack on TRI and threaten Austria’s flank.

This plan aims to take TRI early, weaken Austria, and set the stage for further expansion into the Balkans and Austria’s remaining centers.

**Orders:**

- F NAP - TYS (to threaten Austria and support TRI attack)
- A VEN - TRI (to take TRI from Austria)
- A APU S A VEN - TRI (support VEN into TRI)
- F ION S A VEN - TRI (support TRI attack from the sea)
- A ROM - NAP (hold, defend Italy’s core)
- F NAP H (hold for now, or could be used to support TYS if needed)

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand in the Balkans and Italy to secure additional supply centers. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with potential to expand into RUM, SER, and BUL. The immediate focus should be on consolidating and pushing into these nearby centers, especially RUM and SER, which are only one move away and unclaimed.

Given the current map and the fact that Austria is unfriendly with Germany, France, and England, but neutral with Italy, Russia, and Turkey, I will focus on expanding into RUM and SER, which are the easiest targets for this turn. Moving BUD to RUM and VIE to TRI are both options, but since TRI is already controlled, I will prioritize RUM and SER.

The move A BUD S F TRI is a support move to help Trieste secure the coast, but since Trieste is already controlled, I will use BUD to support RUM instead, which is a critical expansion target. Moving A BUD to RUM is a straightforward expansion move.

VIE can support VIE to GAL or hold. Since I want to push into RUM, I will keep VIE supporting VIE to GAL or hold to maintain flexibility.

For Trieste, I will hold F TRI to prepare for future expansion or support.

Orders:
- A BUD S F TRI (support Trieste)
- A VIE - GAL (expand into Galicia, which is a strategic move to threaten the west and open options for future expansion)
- A VIE H (hold to maintain position)
- A VIE S A BUD - RUM (support BUD to RUM, aiding expansion)
- F TRI H (hold for now, to support future moves)

This setup aims to expand Austria's influence into RUM and GAL, while maintaining flexibility and preparing for further expansion into Serbia and Bulgaria in subsequent turns.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Russia's primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and secure key supply centers, especially in the Balkans and the Black Sea region. Currently, our units are positioned defensively, but we need to shift toward expansion.

- The Sevastopol fleet (F SEV) is well-placed to threaten Turkey and potentially support moves into the Black Sea or the Balkans.
- The army in Moscow (A MOS) can either hold or support an advance into Ukraine (UKR) or support a move into the Baltic (LVN) if opportunities arise.
- The army in War (A WAR) is positioned to support an attack into Galicia (GAL) or move towards Ukraine (UKR) to threaten Austria or Poland.
- The army in Ukraine (A UKR) is a key piece for expansion into the Balkans or supporting the eastern front.

Given the unfriendly relationships with Austria, Germany, and Turkey, I will focus on consolidating the eastern front while preparing to push into the Balkans and Black Sea. I will support moves that threaten Turkey and Austria, and position units to threaten their supply centers.

**Key moves:**
- Support A WAR to move into Galicia (GAL) to threaten Austria.
- Support A MOS to move into Ukraine (UKR) to threaten Austria and Poland.
- F SEV will hold to threaten Turkey and support future Black Sea operations.
- Prepare to support or move units into RUM or BLA to threaten Turkey and Austria.

**Orders:**
- A WAR S A GAL - UKR (support to push into Galicia, threatening Austria)
- A MOS S A UKR - GAL (support to push into Galicia, threatening Austria)
- A UKR - GAL (advance into Galicia to threaten Austria)
- F SEV - ARM (move to threaten Turkey and support Black Sea operations)
- A WAR - UKR (advance into Ukraine to threaten Austria and Poland)

This setup aims to pressure Austria and Turkey, while positioning for further expansion into the Balkans and Black Sea.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the early game to secure key supply centers and build a strong position for world domination. Currently, Turkey controls Ankara, Constantinople, and Smyrna, with nearby unclaimed centers like Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Sevastopol.

- Bulgaria (BUL) and Rumelia (RUM) are critical for expansion into the Balkans and securing additional centers. Bulgaria is only one move away from Ankara, and Rumelia is accessible via support from Smyrna or Ankara.
- Sevastopol (SEV) is a valuable Black Sea center, and Russia's units are distant but could threaten if we overextend.
- Our units are positioned to threaten both the Black Sea and the Balkans, with the fleet in Ankara and armies in Smyrna and Constantinople.

To maximize expansion, I will:
- Use Ankara to support Smyrna into Bulgaria, aiming to take Bulgaria next turn.
- Use Smyrna to support Constantinople into Rumelia, aiming to secure Rumelia.
- Keep Ankara flexible to support or move into Sevastopol if the opportunity arises.
- Maintain a defensive stance with the fleet in Ankara, supporting moves into Bulgaria and Rumelia.

This approach aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia quickly, then pivot to Sevastopol and other centers, while maintaining good relations with Russia for Black Sea cooperation.

**Orders:**
- F ANK S A SMY - BUL (support Smyrna into Bulgaria)
- A SMY S A CON - RUM (support Constantinople into Rumelia)
- A CON H (hold for now, flexible support)
- F SEV - ARM (threaten or support Black Sea expansion, depending on Russian moves)

**Note:** Orders are based on the current possible moves and strategic priorities.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
England strikes first, seizing the North Sea with a slick Edinburgh–London tag-team while Russia unleashes a double jab—Fleet Sevastopol to Armenia and Army Warsaw to Ukraine—suddenly menacing both Ankara and Vienna. Germany races Munich into Silesia, turning the east into a powder keg as three powers now eye Warsaw, while Austria forms a steel wall around Trieste, stonewalling Italy’s opening stab with a booming bounce that reverberates through the Alps. France, Turkey, and most of Italy sit tight, but the board’s fault lines are now glowing red: the Anglo-Russian tempo grab, Germany’s eastern sprint, and that aborted Venetian raid hint that first blood could spill as early as Fall 1901. The crowd can feel it—alliances are still handshakes, yet the knives are already halfway out!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
England strikes first, seizing the North Sea with a slick Edinburgh–London tag-team while Russia unleashes a double jab—Fleet Sevastopol to Armenia and Army Warsaw to Ukraine—suddenly menacing both Ankara and Vienna. Germany races Munich into Silesia, turning the east into a powder keg as three powers now eye Warsaw, while Austria forms a steel wall around Trieste, stonewalling Italy’s opening stab with a booming bounce that reverberates through the Alps. France, Turkey, and most of Italy sit tight, but the board’s fault lines are now glowing red: the Anglo-Russian tempo grab, Germany’s eastern sprint, and that aborted Venetian raid hint that first blood could spill as early as Fall 1901. The crowd can feel it—alliances are still handshakes, yet the knives are already halfway out!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in the Balkans and Anatolia by establishing control over key supply centers such as Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Sevastopol, while maintaining flexibility to respond to neighboring threats.
- Build a strong alliance with Russia to counter Austria and Germany, leveraging shared interests in the Black Sea and Eastern Europe, while preparing for potential conflicts with Western powers.
- Position units to threaten Italy and France from the east and south, aiming to secure the Mediterranean and Italian supply centers early, while avoiding overextension and provoking unnecessary conflicts.

Board State:


PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
England strikes first, seizing the North Sea with a slick Edinburgh–London tag-team while Russia unleashes a double jab—Fleet Sevastopol to Armenia and Army Warsaw to Ukraine—suddenly menacing both Ankara and Vienna. Germany races Munich into Silesia, turning the east into a powder keg as three powers now eye Warsaw, while Austria forms a steel wall around Trieste, stonewalling Italy’s opening stab with a booming bounce that reverberates through the Alps. France, Turkey, and most of Italy sit tight, but the board’s fault lines are now glowing red: the Anglo-Russian tempo grab, Germany’s eastern sprint, and that aborted Venetian raid hint that first blood could spill as early as Fall 1901. The crowd can feel it—alliances are still handshakes, yet the knives are already halfway out!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand influence in Eastern Europe and the Balkans by establishing control over key supply centers such as BUD, WAR, and SEV, while maintaining a defensive posture against potential threats from Germany and Turkey.
- Form a strategic alliance with either Germany or Turkey to counterbalance the Western powers, while preparing for opportunistic strikes against weaker neighbors or overextended opponents.
- Avoid early conflicts with England and France, focusing instead on consolidating the eastern front and preparing for future expansion into the Balkans and the Black Sea region.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles
    - Paris

    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

[S1901M] Russia maintains a defensive stance in the east, with units positioned to defend against potential threats from Germany and Turkey. No new agreements or alliances have been solidified this turn. Relationships with Austria and Germany remain unfriendly, while Turkey and England are neutral. No direct negotiations have been initiated or responded to by Turkey or Germany, indicating possible strategic silence or disengagement.

[S1901M] Russia orders F SEV to ARM, A WAR to UKR, A MOS to hold, and F STP/SC to hold. The strategic focus is on consolidating eastern positions, defending against potential threats, and avoiding early conflicts with Western powers while preparing for future expansion.

[F1901M] Russia maintains a defensive stance in the East, with units positioned to defend Warsaw and monitor German activity. No new agreements or alliances have been solidified; relationships remain largely unchanged, with Austria and Germany unfriendly, Turkey unfriendly, and England and France neutral. The silence from other powers suggests a cautious or strategic withholding of commitments.

- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls 4 centers (MOS, SEV, UKR, WAR). To achieve world domination, we need to seize additional centers, especially in the Balkans and the south, while maintaining a strong eastern front.

- **Focus on the Balkans:** Armenia (ARM) is a key position. Moving ARM to BLA (Black Sea) can threaten Turkey and open a route into the Black Sea, potentially supporting future expansion into Bulgaria or Romania.
- **Secure Sevastopol (SEV):** Holding SEV is crucial for eastern control and to threaten Turkey's holdings.
- **Advance in Ukraine (UKR):** Moving UKR to RUM (Rumania) will threaten the Balkans and open a route into the south.
- **Defend Warsaw:** Keep Warsaw secure against German threats, but be ready to support or reposition if needed.
- **Support the eastern expansion:** Moving A MOS to WAR can threaten Germany or support future moves into the west if opportunities arise.
- **Maintain flexibility:** Hold in STP to avoid overextending, but keep options open for future moves.

Given the current relationships, I will focus on aggressive expansion in the south and east, while maintaining defensive positions in the north and west.

**Orders:**

- ARM to BLA to threaten Turkey and support Black Sea expansion.
- UKR to RUM to threaten the Balkans and support future moves.
- MOS to WAR to threaten Germany or support eastern expansion.
- Hold in STP for flexibility.
- No moves for fleets in the north this turn, as the focus is on expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

[S1901M] No messages involving Germany this round; no new agreements or commitments. Austria remains unfriendly, England is an enemy, France and Italy are neutral, Russia is neutral, Turkey remains unfriendly. The game state shows Germany with units in Kiel, Berlin, and Munich, aiming to secure and expand in Central Europe. Relationships with Austria and Turkey are tense, while others are relatively neutral or hostile.

[S1901M] Germany orders F KIE to DEN, A BER to hold, and A MUN to SIL, aiming to secure Denmark and strengthen central Europe. The strategic focus is on expansion and alliance-building to counter threats and prepare for future offensives.

[F1901M] Germany has maintained a neutral stance with France and Italy, focusing on defensive positioning and monitoring Russian and English movements. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn. Russia remains unfriendly, and England continues to be an adversary, with no response to recent messages. Austria is unfriendly, and Turkey remains neutral. Diplomatic efforts with France and Italy have not yielded concrete alliances or non-aggression pacts, and communication with Russia and England remains limited.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Germany's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure as many supply centers as possible. Currently, our units are positioned to defend our core centers and prepare for expansion.

- The fleet in Denmark (F DEN) is well-placed to threaten or contest control of Scandinavia, especially if England or Russia becomes aggressive.
- The army in Berlin (A BER) can either support the move into Kiel or prepare to push into Prussia or support the attack on Warsaw.
- The army in Silesia (A SIL) is close to the Russian border and can support an attack into Warsaw or defend against Russian advances.
- Our immediate focus should be on expanding into Denmark and possibly into the Low Countries or Scandinavia, while maintaining a strong defense in the east.

Given the current map and possible orders:

- I will support the move from Berlin to Kiel to secure the northern flank.
- I will move the army in Silesia to Warsaw to threaten Russia and potentially force negotiations or gains.
- The fleet in Denmark will move to North Sea to threaten England or support a move into the North Atlantic if needed.
- The army in Berlin will hold to support the move into Kiel.
- The army in Silesia will support the attack on Warsaw.

This approach aims to secure Denmark, threaten Scandinavia, and pressure Russia into negotiations, while maintaining flexibility for future expansion.

**Orders:**

- A BER - KIE (secure Kiel, a key naval and land position)
- A SIL - WAR (threaten or pressure Russia into negotiations)
- F DEN - NTH (threaten England, contest control of the North Sea)

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:

4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand into new supply centers, especially in the Balkans and Italy, while maintaining a strong defensive position. Given the current map, I see opportunities to push into Serbia and potentially threaten Italy's centers, which could help us secure more centers and weaken our enemies.

- BUD is a critical position; I will support VIE to hold and prepare to support or move into RUM or SER.
- VIE can either hold or push into GAL to threaten Russia or support BUD.
- TRI is well-positioned to support an attack on VEN or to hold for defense. I will hold TRI for now, as Italy is neutral and may be a future target.
- I will move A BUD to support A UKR into GAL, aiming to threaten Russia and gain influence in the east.
- I will also consider supporting A VIE into GAL to threaten Russia further or hold VIE to defend against Russian or German threats.

This approach aims to threaten Russia in the east, expand into Serbia and Rumania, and prepare for future aggressive moves into Italy or the Balkans.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A UKR - GAL (support UKR into GAL, threatening Russia)
- A VIE - GAL (advance into GAL to threaten Russia and support BUD)
- A TRI H (hold for now, maintaining flexibility)
- F TRI H (hold, as no immediate threat)
- A VIE S A BUD - RUM (support BUD into RUM, aiming to secure RUM)
- Support or hold units to maintain flexibility and prepare for future expansion.

**Final Orders:**

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is ITALY. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: ITALY
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Strengthen control of Naples, Rome, and Venice to solidify Italy's core positions.
- Establish defensive positions in the east, particularly around Trieste and Venice, to counter Austria's and Germany’s advances.
- Seek diplomatic negotiations with France and Turkey to form limited non-aggression pacts or alliances for mutual security.
- Monitor German and Russian movements closely, prepare to defend against their expansion, and consider opportunistic strikes if weaknesses appear.
- Position fleets and armies to threaten Austria and Germany, aiming to capitalize on their aggressive postures in subsequent turns.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Neutral
- GERMANY: Enemy
- RUSSIA: Enemy
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy has maintained a neutral stance with France and Germany, focusing on consolidating control over NAP, ROM, and VEN. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn. Austria remains unfriendly, and Turkey is unfriendly, with no direct negotiations ongoing. The silence from other powers suggests a cautious or strategic withholding of commitments.

[S1901M] Italy orders F NAP to TYS, A VEN to TRI, and holds A ROM and F NAP. The strategic intent is to secure key Italian centers, avoid early conflicts, and prepare for potential threats from Turkey and Germany while maintaining a cautious, expansionist posture.

[F1901M] Italy has maintained a neutral stance with France and Turkey, with no recent messages from them. Relations with Austria remain unfriendly, and Germany and Russia are considered enemies, with no recent communication. Italy's units are positioned defensively in Naples, Rome, and Venice, with fleets ready to threaten Austria and Germany. No new agreements or alliances have been established this turn.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's primary focus is on consolidating control over Naples, Rome, and Venice, which are our core centers. Given the current game state, we should aim to expand cautiously but aggressively to secure additional centers, especially in Greece and the Balkans, to build toward the 18 centers needed for victory.

- NAP is currently held by F NAP, and moving to TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea) supports future expansion into the central Mediterranean or to threaten France or Austria.
- ROM is held by A ROM, with options to support or attack Austria's Trieste or defend against potential threats.
- VEN is held by A VEN, with options to support or attack Austria's BUD or TRI, or to hold position to defend against Austria's units.

Given Austria's unfriendly stance and the proximity of their units, I will focus on strengthening our position in the south and east, while preparing to threaten Austria's centers in Trieste and Vienna. I will also consider supporting moves to push into Greece (GRC) or Bulgaria (BUL) in subsequent turns, but for now, I will keep units defensive and supportive.

I will order NAP to move to TYS to threaten Austria's Trieste and prepare for expansion into Greece or the Balkans. Rome will hold to maintain stability, and Venice will support the attack on Trieste if needed.

**Orders:**

- F NAP to TYS (support future expansion and threaten Austria)
- A ROM to TUS (to prepare for future expansion into the Balkans or defend)
- A VEN to TRI (to threaten Austria's Trieste and support future attacks)
- Support A VEN to TRI with A ROM if needed in subsequent turns, but for now, hold.

**Final Orders:**

- F NAP - TYS
- A ROM - TUS
- A VEN - TRI
- Support A VEN - TRI with A ROM (if support is needed later, but support orders are not specified now, so I will leave it as a move)

**Note:** Since the only support orders available are support for moves, and support orders must match actual moves, I will not issue a support order now unless explicitly needed. For this turn, I will keep it simple and focus on moves.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand control and secure supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I hold LON, LVP, and EDI, with potential to push into the Low Countries and Scandinavia. I want to leverage my friendly relationship with France to coordinate a joint effort against Germany and possibly Italy, while preparing to threaten or support moves into Belgium and Holland.

- I will move F LON to YOR to threaten or potentially take the Yorkshire supply center, which is close and valuable.
- I will support F NTH to move into the North Sea, aiming to secure dominance over the channel and North Sea.
- I will move F NTH to DEN to threaten or take the Danish supply center, which is a key expansion point into Scandinavia.
- I will support F DEN to move into the North Sea, reinforcing my naval presence and preparing for expansion.
- I will hold A LVP, as it is a valuable position for future support or defense.
- I will move A LVP to YOR to threaten the Yorkshire supply center, aiming to secure it or force German response.
- I will support A LVP to YOR from YOR itself, reinforcing the attack.
- I will also prepare to support moves into Belgium or Holland if opportunities arise, but for now, focus on Scandinavia and the North Sea.

This aggressive stance aims to secure key centers early, especially DEN and YOR, while maintaining flexibility for future alliances and attacks.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively into the Balkans and secure additional supply centers. Currently, Turkey controls three centers: ANK, CON, and SMY. To reach 18 centers, we need to seize nearby unclaimed centers like Bulgaria (BUL), Rumania (RUM), and potentially push into Greece or the Aegean.

Given the current map and the possible moves, the most strategic move is to support our units to expand into Bulgaria and Rumania, which are only two moves away. The key is to use our fleets and armies to threaten and potentially take control of these centers.

- Moving F ANK to BLA (Black Sea) can threaten Bulgaria and Rumania, and support moves into those centers.
- Moving A CON to BUL is a direct attempt to seize Bulgaria.
- Moving A SMY to SEV (Sevastopol) or RUM (Rumania) can threaten those centers, but RUM is farther away, so a move to SEV might be more immediate.
- Supporting moves from F ANK to BLA will help secure Black Sea control and threaten Bulgaria.
- Holding units in Smyrna and Ankara for now to maintain flexibility.

The overall plan is to push into Bulgaria and Rumania, while maintaining a strong Black Sea presence to threaten RUS and control the region.

**Orders:**

- F ANK S A SMY - BLA (support Smyrna to Black Sea to threaten Bulgaria)
- A CON - BUL (attack Bulgaria directly)
- A SMY - SEV (threaten Sevastopol and Rumania)
- F ANK - BLA (move fleet to Black Sea to support and threaten Bulgaria)
- Hold units in Smyrna and Ankara for flexibility

This aggressive stance aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumania quickly, pushing Turkey closer to the 18 centers needed for victory.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom! Germany blitzes through Warsaw, seizing a fifth center and surging into the early lead while Russia reels from the sucker punch. Simultaneously, the Bosporus detonates—Turkey shoves its fleet into the Black Sea and bags Bulgaria, muscling ahead of a stunned Austria. Out west the North Sea roars as English and German fleets collide in a DEN-NTH stand-off, with calm, coiled France eyeing the chaos from fortified shores. Italy’s stab at Trieste clanks off Austrian armor in Galicia, leaving every alliance wobbling and 1902 primed for fireworks.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom! Germany blitzes through Warsaw, seizing a fifth center and surging into the early lead while Russia reels from the sucker punch. Simultaneously, the Bosporus detonates—Turkey shoves its fleet into the Black Sea and bags Bulgaria, muscling ahead of a stunned Austria. Out west the North Sea roars as English and German fleets collide in a DEN-NTH stand-off, with calm, coiled France eyeing the chaos from fortified shores. Italy’s stab at Trieste clanks off Austrian armor in Galicia, leaving every alliance wobbling and 1902 primed for fireworks.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Strengthen control of Naples, Rome, and Venice to solidify Italy's core positions.
- Establish defensive positions in the east, particularly around Trieste and Venice, to counter Austria's and Germany’s advances.
- Seek diplomatic negotiations with France and Turkey to form limited non-aggression pacts or alliances for mutual security.
- Monitor German and Russian movements closely, prepare to defend against their expansion, and consider opportunistic strikes if weaknesses appear.
- Position fleets and armies to threaten Austria and Germany, aiming to capitalize on their aggressive postures in subsequent turns.

Board State:


PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
Boom! Germany blitzes through Warsaw, seizing a fifth center and surging into the early lead while Russia reels from the sucker punch. Simultaneously, the Bosporus detonates—Turkey shoves its fleet into the Black Sea and bags Bulgaria, muscling ahead of a stunned Austria. Out west the North Sea roars as English and German fleets collide in a DEN-NTH stand-off, with calm, coiled France eyeing the chaos from fortified shores. Italy’s stab at Trieste clanks off Austrian armor in Galicia, leaving every alliance wobbling and 1902 primed for fireworks.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Defend Warsaw against German advances, possibly by repositioning armies or fleets.
- Secure and expand influence in the Balkans by supporting Armenia and Ukraine to establish control over key centers.
- Form a strategic alliance with Turkey to counterbalance German and Austrian threats in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.
- Monitor Austria's stronghold around Trieste and prepare to exploit any weaknesses or shifts in their position.
- Avoid early conflict with England while maintaining readiness to respond to northern threats.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Germany this round; no new agreements or commitments. Austria remains unfriendly, England is an enemy, France and Italy are neutral, Russia is neutral, Turkey remains unfriendly. The game state shows Germany with units in Kiel, Berlin, and Munich, aiming to secure and expand in Central Europe. Relationships with Austria and Turkey are tense, while others are relatively neutral or hostile.

[S1901M] Germany orders F KIE to DEN, A BER to hold, and A MUN to SIL, aiming to secure Denmark and strengthen central Europe. The strategic focus is on expansion and alliance-building to counter threats and prepare for future offensives.

[F1901M] Germany has maintained a neutral stance with France and Italy, focusing on defensive positioning and monitoring Russian and English movements. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn. Russia remains unfriendly, and England continues to be an adversary, with no response to recent messages. Austria is unfriendly, and Turkey remains neutral. Diplomatic efforts with France and Italy have not yielded concrete alliances or non-aggression pacts, and communication with Russia and England remains limited.

[F1901M] Germany orders A BER to KIE, A SIL to WAR, and F DEN to NTH, with a hold order for A BER. The strategic focus is on consolidating eastern positions, defending Warsaw, and preparing for potential expansion or diplomacy in the north and east.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Germany's primary goal is to expand aggressively while maintaining a strong defensive posture in the east, especially around Warsaw, and contesting the North Sea with England. Given the current game state, I want to secure Denmark and prepare for potential expansion into Scandinavia or the North Sea, while also keeping options open for eastern or southern expansion depending on diplomatic developments.

- I will move F DEN to NTH to contest the North Sea and threaten England's supply centers.
- I will support A BER to KIE to strengthen my hold in the north and prepare for future expansion.
- I will move A WAR to hold for now, as I want to reinforce Warsaw's defense against Russia and keep my options open.
- I will also prepare to support or move units based on diplomacy, but for now, I will hold Munich and Berlin to consolidate my position.

This setup aims to pressure England in the north, secure Denmark, and keep my eastern flank stable while I look for opportunities to expand into Scandinavia or the Low Countries.

**Orders:**

- F DEN - NTH
- A BER - KIE
- A WAR H
- A MUN - SIL (supporting a future move or holding position)
- A SIL - WAR (support to defend Warsaw if needed)

**Note:** I will hold Munich and Berlin for now, as I want to see how the diplomacy unfolds before committing further.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

[S1901M] Russia maintains a defensive stance in the east, with units positioned to defend against potential threats from Germany and Turkey. No new agreements or alliances have been solidified this turn. Relationships with Austria and Germany remain unfriendly, while Turkey and England are neutral. No direct negotiations have been initiated or responded to by Turkey or Germany, indicating possible strategic silence or disengagement.

[S1901M] Russia orders F SEV to ARM, A WAR to UKR, A MOS to hold, and F STP/SC to hold. The strategic focus is on consolidating eastern positions, defending against potential threats, and avoiding early conflicts with Western powers while preparing for future expansion.

[F1901M] Russia maintains a defensive stance in the East, with units positioned to defend Warsaw and monitor German activity. No new agreements or alliances have been solidified; relationships remain largely unchanged, with Austria and Germany unfriendly, Turkey unfriendly, and England and France neutral. The silence from other powers suggests a cautious or strategic withholding of commitments.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls only 4 centers (MOS, SEV, UKR, STP). To achieve world domination, we need to seize nearby Turkish centers, especially Ankara (ANK), Bulgaria (BUL), and Smyrna (SMY), which are within reach and critical for expansion.

- The Turkish units are positioned in Smyrna, Bulgaria, and Ankara, with Smyrna and Bulgaria being more accessible. Our fleet in ARM can move to support or threaten Smyrna, and our armies in UKR and MOS can coordinate to push into Bulgaria and Ankara.
- The most immediate opportunity is to move ARM to support a move into Smyrna or support an attack on Bulgaria, depending on Turkish responses.
- UKR can move to support an attack on Bulgaria or Ankara, depending on Turkish positioning.
- MOS can hold or support, but given our aggressive stance, we should consider supporting UKR or moving to threaten Turkey directly.
- We should aim to threaten or take Smyrna and Bulgaria this turn, then follow up in subsequent turns to take Ankara and other centers.

Given the current orders options, the best move is to support a push into Smyrna from ARM, while UKR and MOS prepare to support or threaten Turkish centers.

**Proposed Orders:**

- ARM moves to support or threaten Smyrna (F ARM D), possibly supporting an attack if Turkey moves units into Greece.
- UKR moves to support Bulgaria or Ankara, depending on Turkish moves.
- MOS holds or supports to prepare for future expansion.
- Support moves to threaten Smyrna or Bulgaria.

**Orders:**

- F ARM D (to threaten Smyrna or support an attack)
- A UKR S A BUD - BUL (supporting an attack on Bulgaria if Turkish units move away)
- A MOS - UKR (to threaten or support movement into Ukraine or support the attack)
- Support options for other units depending on Turkish response.

**In summary:**

- Focus on aggressive expansion into Turkish-controlled centers.
- Use fleet ARM to threaten Smyrna.
- Use armies UKR and MOS to support or threaten Bulgaria and Ankara.
- Prepare to capitalize on Turkish weaknesses next turn.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand into the Balkans and secure additional supply centers, especially from the east and south. Russia remains friendly, which is advantageous for coordinated expansion into the Black Sea and the Balkans. Austria is unfriendly and controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, which are key targets for us. Germany is an enemy, and France and England are hostile, so we need to be cautious in the west and focus on consolidating our position in the east and south.

Currently, our units are positioned defensively: A SMY, F BLA, and A BUL. We have convoy options from Constantinople to Bulgaria, which can be used to support an attack into Bulgaria or move into the Balkans. Our fleet in the Black Sea (F BLA) can support or convoy as needed.

Our immediate strategic move is to prepare for an attack on Bulgaria (BUL) to gain a critical supply center. Supporting this move with a convoy from Constantinople to Bulgaria will be effective, especially if Russia is willing to support or coordinate.

Additionally, we should reinforce our holdings in Smyrna and Sevastopol, and consider positioning fleets to threaten Austria's centers or to support future expansion into Greece or the Aegean.

Given the current map and relationships, I will order:

- Convoy from Constantinople to Bulgaria to threaten or take BUL.
- Support the move A BUL - BUD if possible, or prepare to attack BUD directly.
- Hold Smyrna to maintain control.
- Keep the fleet in the Black Sea (F BLA) supporting the convoy or moving to threaten Greece or the Aegean.

This aggressive stance aims to capitalize on Austria's hostility and Russia's friendliness, pushing into the Balkans to secure more centers.

---

**Orders:**

- Convoy F CON - BUL
- A BUL - BUD (supporting the convoy if needed)
- A SMY H
- F BLA - AEG (to threaten Greece and support future operations)
- F ARM - SEV (to reinforce Black Sea control and support expansion)

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
The crowd roars as Germany slams down a ferocious one-two punch—fresh fleet in Kiel, new army in Munich—vaulting the Kaiser to a commanding five-center lead before the first spring thaw! Turkey muscles up with an extra army in Ankara, hinting at Balkan ambitions while the Sultan’s discarded Con build leaves neighbors guessing. Russia fumbles the paperwork, accidentally scrapping the lonely Armenian fleet and voiding two disbands, a blunder that dulls the Bear’s claws just as the knives are coming out. With France, England, Italy, and Austria frozen in place, the stage is set for a blistering 1902 where Berlin’s blitz and Istanbul’s intrigue could redraw the map in a heartbeat!

  ""reasoning"": ""Germany's rapid expansion with a fleet in Kiel and an army in Munich has established a dominant position early, making them a clear enemy. Turkey's buildup in Ankara suggests Balkan ambitions, and their discard of a build indicates potential unpredictability—unfriendly. Russia's mistake in disbanding fleets weakens their northern position, but their move into Sweden remains a concern; they are an enemy. France remains friendly, likely due to mutual interests in countering Germany. Austria and Italy are currently inactive or engaged in skirmishes, but their positions could shift, so they are neutral for now. Overall, Germany's aggressive stance and Turkey's expansion threaten my northern and southern borders, requiring a focus on containment and alliance-building."",
