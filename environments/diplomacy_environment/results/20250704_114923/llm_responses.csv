intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My immediate goal is to secure and expand control over Italy’s key centers—Venice, Rome, and Naples—while positioning for aggressive expansion into Austria and France. Given Austria’s hostility, I want to threaten Trieste and Buda early, while also preparing to challenge France in the west.

- I will move the fleet from Naples to the Tyrrhenian Sea to threaten the French coast and prepare for future expansion.
- The army in Rome will hold, maintaining a strong position in the capital.
- The army in Venice will support an attack on Trieste, supported by the fleet in Ionian Sea, aiming to take Trieste from Austria.
- The army in Apulia will support the Venice attack, reinforcing the effort to push into Austria’s territory.
- I will also consider a support move from Venice to Trieste to ensure success, but since the move options are limited, I will focus on the direct attack.

This aggressive stance aims to seize Trieste early, threaten Austria’s supply centers, and set the stage for further expansion into the Balkans and France.

**Orders:**

- A VEN - TRI
- A APU S A VEN - TRI
- F ION S A VEN - TRI
- A ROM H
- F NAP - TYS

**This plan aims to secure Trieste, threaten Austria, and position for further expansion.**

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Germany controls Berlin, Kiel, and Munich. To achieve world domination, we need to push into Scandinavia, the Low Countries, and potentially Eastern Europe.

- **Kiel (KIE)**: The fleet here is well-positioned to move into Denmark (DEN) or support the attack on Holland (HOL). Securing DEN early is critical for expansion into Scandinavia.
- **Berlin (BER)**: Moving into Prussia (PRU) will threaten Russia and open up the Baltic, while also supporting future pushes into Scandinavia.
- **Munich (MUN)**: The army can support the move into Silesia (SIL) or prepare to push eastward into Poland or support the attack on Denmark via Kiel.
- **Support and aggression**: Moving F KIE to DEN and A BER to PRU will threaten Russia and open new fronts. Holding MUN for now, but ready to support or pivot as needed.

Given the hostile relationships with Russia, Austria, Turkey, and France, I want to establish a foothold in Scandinavia and the Low Countries while maintaining flexibility for future moves.

**Orders:**

- Fleet in KIE to DEN (to secure Scandinavia)
- Army in BER to PRU (to threaten Russia and secure Baltic access)
- Army in MUN to SIL (to threaten Poland and support future expansion)
- Hold MUN for now, but keep options open
- Support move from MUN to SIL if needed in subsequent turns

**Support moves**: No supports are necessary this turn, just positioning for expansion.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand and secure supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control 3 centers (EDI, LON, LVP). I need to aggressively push into neighboring unclaimed centers, especially in Belgium, the Netherlands, and potentially Scandinavia, while maintaining naval dominance in the North Sea and English Channel.

Germany remains neutral, which offers an opportunity to coordinate or at least avoid conflict this turn. France is unfriendly, so I should be cautious about their moves, especially in the west. Russia and Austria are unfriendly, but I can focus on consolidating my northern and western positions first.

I will:
- Move F EDI to NWG to threaten or contest the North Sea and gain access to Scandinavia later.
- Move F LON to NTH to threaten or contest the North Sea and support future expansion.
- Use LVP to support moves into Belgium or the Netherlands if opportunities arise.
- Keep units flexible for future expansion, supporting or holding as needed.

This approach aims to establish naval dominance, threaten France and the Low Countries, and set up for rapid expansion in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- F EDI - NWG
- F LON - NTH
- A LVP - BEL (to threaten or support future moves into Belgium)
- A LVP S F EDI - NWG (supporting the fleet move to NWG)
- A LVP S F LON - NTH (supporting the fleet move to NTH)

**Note:** Since only the listed moves are available, I will prioritize moves that threaten key areas and keep units flexible for future expansion.

   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and secure key supply centers, especially in the Balkans and Ukraine, while maintaining a strong position against Turkey and Austria.

- I will move A MOS to SEV to threaten Turkey’s holdings and potentially cut off their access to the Black Sea, while also preparing to push into RUM or support other units.
- A WAR will move to GAL to threaten Austria’s BUD and VIE, aiming to pressure Austria and open up opportunities for future expansion.
- F SEV will support A WAR to ensure it reaches GAL, and also threaten Turkey’s holdings in the south.
- I will keep F STP/SC on support to maintain control of the northern coast and prepare for future moves into the Baltic or support other units.
- I will hold A UKR for now, as it can support or pivot depending on developments.

This setup aims to pressure Austria and Turkey simultaneously, while positioning for future expansion into RUM, BUD, and the Balkans.

**Orders:**

- A MOS - SEV (to threaten Turkey and prepare for Black Sea expansion)
- A WAR - GAL (to threaten Austria and open a front in the west)
- F SEV - RUM (to threaten Turkey and support future moves)
- F STP/SC H (hold to maintain control of the coast and support other units)
- A UKR H (hold for now, ready to pivot)

This aggressive stance aligns with my goal of expansion and domination, while maintaining flexibility for future turns.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand in the Balkans and Italy, while maintaining a defensive posture against Germany and France. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with potential to push into RUM, SER, and BUL, which are nearby supply centers.

Given the unfriendly relations with Germany and France, I want to avoid overextending into their zones but still seize opportunities for expansion. The immediate focus should be on consolidating and expanding in the Balkans and Italy, while preparing for future aggressive moves.

- I will support the move from A VIE to TRI to secure Trieste, a key supply center, and prepare to push into RUM and SER next turn.
- Moving A BUD to TRI is risky, but it could threaten Italy's supply centers if Italy remains neutral or weak.
- Moving A BUD to RUM is a strategic move to threaten Russia's southeastern centers, especially if Russia is overextended or distracted.
- Supporting A VIE to TRI with A VIE is a safe move to ensure Trieste's security.
- Moving F TRI to support A VIE to TRI is a flexible move, possibly to support a future attack or defend against Italian or Turkish threats.
- Moving A VIE to VIE is a hold, maintaining control over Vienna.
- Moving A VIE to BUD is an option if I want to threaten Austria's own centers or prepare for a future move into Galicia or further into the Balkans.

This setup aims to secure Trieste, threaten RUM, and keep options open for expansion into the Balkans and Italy, while avoiding unnecessary risks with Germany and France.

**Orders:**

- Support A VIE to TRI
- A BUD - TRI
- A VIE - VIE
- A VIE - BUD
- F TRI S A VIE - TRI

**Note:** I will hold the units in Vienna and Trieste to keep flexibility and support the expansion.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the east and secure key supply centers, especially Bulgaria (BUL), Rumania (RUM), and potentially Sevastopol (SEV). Currently, Turkey controls ANK, CON, and SMY, with nearby unclaimed centers at BUL, RUM, and SEV.

- Bulgaria (BUL) is only one move away from ANK via BLA, which is a water territory supporting the move. Securing BUL will give us a crucial supply center and a foothold in the Balkans.
- Rumania (RUM) is also close, accessible via BLA, and will further expand our influence in Eastern Europe.
- Sevastopol (SEV) is a bit further but still within reach, especially if we can coordinate with Russia or threaten from the Black Sea.

Given our friendly relationship with Russia, we should aim to support their expansion into Sevastopol or Rumania if possible, but our immediate focus is on securing Bulgaria to strengthen our position.

Our units:
- F ANK: best used to support the move to BUL.
- A CON: can move to BUL directly, supported by F ANK.
- A SMY: can move to ARM or support the move to BUL.

Orders:
- F ANK should hold or support the move to BUL.
- A CON should move to BUL to secure it.
- A SMY can support A CON or move to ARM if needed, but for now, supporting the move to BUL is a priority.

This aggressive move will help us secure a new supply center and set the stage for further expansion into Rumania and the Black Sea.

**Orders:**
- F ANK S A CON - BUL (supporting A CON to BUL)
- A CON - BUL (moving to secure Bulgaria)
- A SMY S A CON (supporting A CON if needed, or holding to support the move)

**Note:** We will hold SMY for now to support the move to BUL, but if the opportunity arises, we can shift units to threaten Rumania or Sevastopol in subsequent turns.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
The guns have barely cooled and already the Russian bear is roaring—War-to-Gal and Sev-to-Rum land unopposed, cutting straight into Austria’s heartland while the czar masses four units on the Balkans’ doorstep. Vienna panics and stumbles into a self-inflicted traffic jam as Bud and Vie bounce each other and Italy’s Ven-to-Tri lunge is stonewalled, leaving the Habsburgs frozen in place. Out west the seas explode with white sails: England storms into both the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, Germany snatches Denmark and parks an army in Prussia, while France steadies its guns in a tense silence. But the headline is Bulgaria—Turkey plants its flag, botches a Smyrna support, yet still joins Russia in surrounding Austria; the stage is set for an autumn bloodbath where the first real betrayals will decide the fate of the Balkans.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
The guns have barely cooled and already the Russian bear is roaring—War-to-Gal and Sev-to-Rum land unopposed, cutting straight into Austria’s heartland while the czar masses four units on the Balkans’ doorstep. Vienna panics and stumbles into a self-inflicted traffic jam as Bud and Vie bounce each other and Italy’s Ven-to-Tri lunge is stonewalled, leaving the Habsburgs frozen in place. Out west the seas explode with white sails: England storms into both the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, Germany snatches Denmark and parks an army in Prussia, while France steadies its guns in a tense silence. But the headline is Bulgaria—Turkey plants its flag, botches a Smyrna support, yet still joins Russia in surrounding Austria; the stage is set for an autumn bloodbath where the first real betrayals will decide the fate of the Balkans.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand influence in Eastern Europe and the Balkans by establishing control over key supply centers such as BUD, WAR, and SEV.
- Form a strategic alliance with Germany to contain France and Italy, while preparing for a potential eastern front against Turkey and Austria.
- Exploit the early game opportunities to pressure Turkey in the south and push into the Balkans, aiming to secure additional supply centers like ANK and CON.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles
    - Paris

    - Berlin
    - Kiel
    - Munich

    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Defend Berlin and Prussia against Russian advances, possibly by moving armies to block or threaten Russian units.
- Seek diplomatic negotiations with France and England to establish defensive or non-aggression agreements, avoiding a two-front encirclement.
- Prepare to counter Russian expansion into the Baltic and Galicia, and consider supporting Austria if possible to slow Russian momentum.
- Maintain flexibility in the west to respond to French or English moves, while focusing on eastern defense.
- Explore opportunities to form a temporary alliance or non-aggression pact with Turkey to contain Russia.

- ENGLAND: Unfriendly
- FRANCE: Neutral
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Enemy
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages involving Germany this turn, indicating a focus on internal positioning or strategic silence. Relationships remain hostile with Austria, Russia, Turkey, and enemy with England. France and Italy are unfriendly, but no direct engagement this round.

[S1901M] I have ordered F KIE to DEN to secure Scandinavia, A BER to PRU to contest the Baltic, and A MUN to SIL to push into Scandinavia and threaten Russia. I am holding A MUN in place to support future moves and maintain flexibility. These orders aim to expand into Scandinavia and strengthen the eastern front while avoiding early conflicts with neighbors.

[F1901M] Germany has maintained a defensive stance with a focus on eastern borders, with no new agreements or commitments from France or England. Russia remains hostile, with no cooperation established. Austria and Turkey are unfriendly, with limited engagement. Italy remains neutral, and France is neutral but unresponsive. No significant diplomatic breakthroughs this turn.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively into Scandinavia and secure eastern centers, while maintaining a defensive posture against Russia and preparing for future expansion. I have already moved F DEN to NTH to threaten England and gain control of Scandinavia, and A MUN to SIL to threaten Russia and contest Galicia. Supporting moves and positioning are aimed at consolidating eastern gains and preparing for a broader push into the Baltic and Scandinavia.

Given the current map and relationships, I want to:

- Secure Scandinavia by moving F DEN to NTH, which threatens England and positions for future expansion.
- Use A MUN to support moves into Scandinavia or Galicia, depending on Russian or French responses.
- Keep options open for future moves into Sweden or the Baltic.
- Maintain a defensive stance in the west, with no immediate threat from France or England, but stay alert for their moves.

I will support the move of A PRU to WAR to threaten Russian centers and keep pressure on Russia, while also preparing to support or defend as needed.

**Orders:**

- F DEN to NTH: To threaten England and gain influence over Scandinavia.
- A MUN to SIL: To threaten Russia and contest Galicia.
- A PRU to WAR: To threaten Russian centers and keep Russian units occupied.
- Hold units in BER and KIE for flexibility and defense.

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy's messages have been responsive, with no significant agreements yet. The focus remains on securing Trieste, Venice, and Rome, while maintaining a cautious stance towards Austria and France. Relationships with Austria and Russia are hostile, with France unfriendly and Germany neutral. England and Russia are unresponsive, indicating potential strategic silence or disinterest. No formal alliances or commitments have been established this turn.

[S1901M] I am moving A VEN to TRI to secure Trieste, holding A ROM in place to defend Italy's core, and sending F NAP to TYS to threaten the Tyrrhenian Sea and prepare for expansion or defense.

[F1901M] Italy has maintained a neutral stance with France and Germany, focusing on consolidating its centers and monitoring the eastern and Balkan fronts. Russia remains an ally, and Turkey is a strategic partner. No new agreements have been reached this turn, but communication remains open. Austria is considered an enemy, and England remains unfriendly, though silent this round.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand Italy’s control over supply centers to reach 18 and achieve world domination. Currently, I control Rome, Venice, and Naples, with potential to expand into Trieste, Austria, and France.

- I have a strong position in the south and central Italy, with units in Rome, Venice, and Tyrrhenian Sea.
- I want to secure Trieste from Austria, which is hostile and controls Trieste, Buda, and Vienna. Moving A ROM to support A VEN to TRI is a good move, supported by F TYS to threaten or support the attack.
- I will also move A VEN to TRI, supported by A APU, to threaten Austria’s key center.
- F TYS will support the attack on Trieste from the sea, increasing the chance of success.
- I will hold Rome to defend against any French or Austrian threats.
- I will move NAP to TYS to threaten the Tyrrhenian Sea and prepare for future expansion or defense.

This aggressive stance aims to take Trieste early, which is crucial for expansion into Austria and the Balkans, and to threaten France’s southern centers. Securing Trieste will give me a vital foothold in the east, and I can pivot to other fronts next turn.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers. Currently, Turkey controls Ankara, Smyrna, and Bulgaria, with Bulgaria being the closest unclaimed supply center. Bulgaria is only two moves away from Ankara, and taking it will significantly increase our supply count.

Since Russia is friendly, I want to maintain that alliance, but I also need to be bold in expanding into Bulgaria. The best move is to support Bulgaria's army from Smyrna to push into Bulgaria, which is unclaimed and within reach.

The fleet in Ankara can hold or support the attack on Bulgaria. The fleet in Smyrna should support the army in Bulgaria to ensure its success. The fleet in Ankara can also move to the Black Sea (BLA) to threaten or contest Russian interests there, but for now, I will keep it supporting Bulgaria.

The main move is to support A BUL from Smyrna to secure Bulgaria. This will help us gain a critical supply center and move closer to our victory condition.

**Order choices:**

- A BUL S A SMY - BUL (support Bulgaria's army from Smyrna)
- F ANK - CON (to threaten or support future expansion in the eastern Mediterranean)
- F SMY - CON (support Bulgaria's army to ensure success)
- F ANK H (hold Ankara to defend and prepare for future moves)

This aggressive stance on Bulgaria is essential for rapid expansion, and supporting Bulgaria's army from Smyrna is the most direct way to secure it.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

- Seek diplomatic engagement with Germany and Italy to coordinate naval or land moves against Russia and Austria.
- Prepare to support Belgium or the Low Countries if France or Germany attempt further expansion.
- Establish a flexible alliance with Germany to counter Russian and Austrian threats while remaining open to opportunistic diplomacy with Turkey or France.
- Prioritize securing and expanding influence in Western Europe, especially in France and Belgium, through strategic moves or negotiations.
Relationships: - FRANCE: Unfriendly
- GERMANY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Enemy
- TURKEY: Neutral
- AUSTRIA: Enemy
- ITALY: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No messages received from France, Russia, or Austria, indicating possible hostility or disinterest. Germany remains neutral and responsive, while Italy and Turkey are neutral. No formal agreements or commitments established this turn, but the overall environment suggests a need to focus on consolidating northern and western positions while preparing for potential conflicts with France and Russia.

[S1901M] England is moving F EDI to NWG to threaten the North Sea, F LON to NTH to secure the English Channel, and holding A LVP to maintain a flexible position. The strategy aims to establish naval dominance, secure maritime routes, and prepare for expansion into Scandinavia and the Low Countries while maintaining diplomatic flexibility with Germany.

[F1901M] England maintains a defensive stance in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, with no new agreements or commitments from other powers. Germany remains neutral, and there are no active negotiations with France, Austria, or Russia. Italy and Turkey are neutral and unresponsive, respectively. The overall diplomatic environment is cautious, with no significant shifts or alliances formed.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand and secure supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control three centers (LON, EDI, LVP). To achieve world domination, I need to aggressively expand into neighboring unowned centers, especially in Scandinavia and the Low Countries, while maintaining a strong naval presence in the North Sea and English Channel.

- I will move F NWG to EDI to threaten the Norwegian Sea and prepare for future expansion into Scandinavia.
- I will move F NTH to YOR to threaten the Yorkshire area and support potential moves into the North Sea or the Low Countries.
- I will support A LVP to EDI to reinforce my control of the English Channel and prepare for expansion into Belgium or the Low Countries.
- I will also consider moving A LVP to CLY to threaten the coast of Belgium or support a move into the Low Countries if the opportunity arises.

This setup aims to secure the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, threaten key centers, and position for expansion into Scandinavia and the Low Countries in subsequent turns. I will remain flexible and ready to shift based on diplomacy and opponent moves.

**Orders:**

- F NWG - EDI
- F NTH - YOR
- A LVP S F NTH - YOR
- A LVP - CLY
- F NTH - NTH (Hold for flexibility)

**Note:** Support orders are only used if moves are confirmed, but for now, I will hold the support for flexibility.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, confirming their support for my strategic positioning in the east. No new commitments from Austria, England, Italy, or Turkey; their responses remain neutral or unfriendly. No direct negotiations with France or Turkey this round, but their hostility persists. All powers have been responsive, with the exception of Turkey which remains openly hostile.

[S1901M] Russia orders A MOS to SEV, A WAR to GAL, F SEV to RUM, and holds in STP/SC. The strategy aims to secure the eastern front, pressure Turkey and Austria, and strengthen alliances with Germany while preparing for expansion in the Balkans.

[F1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Germany, focusing on mutual defense and eastern expansion. Austria and Italy remain unfriendly, with Austria showing signs of weakness, which can be exploited. England and Turkey are unfriendly, with limited communication from England. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn, but the overall strategic posture remains aligned with expansion into Eastern Europe and containment of Western powers.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in Eastern Europe and secure additional supply centers. Currently, Russia controls St. Petersburg, Sevastopol, and Warsaw, with a strong position in the east. Austria is weak and unfriendly, and Turkey is hostile, so we should capitalize on Austria's vulnerability by pushing into Budapest and Galicia.

In the north, St. Petersburg is well-defended, but we should maintain pressure on the Baltic and consider supporting or repositioning to threaten Sweden or Norway if opportunities arise. Our fleet in RUM can threaten the Black Sea and support Sevastopol or move into the Balkans if needed.

Given the current map and options, I will:

- Support A GAL to BUD to push into Austria's key supply center.
- Use A SEV to support A GAL into BUD, reinforcing the attack.
- Move F RUM to BLA to threaten Turkey and support our Black Sea position.
- Hold in STP/SC to maintain control and defend against potential German or British moves.
- Use A WAR to support A GAL into BUD, or hold if necessary, but support seems more strategic to push into Austria.

This aggressive stance aims to secure BUD and GAL early, setting us up for further expansion into Austria and potentially Romania or Ukraine in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- A GAL S A SEV - UKR
- A SEV S A GAL - BUD
- F RUM - BLA
- A WAR S A GAL - BUD
- F STP/SC H

This plan supports a strong push into Austria's key centers, while maintaining flexibility and pressure on Turkey and the Baltic region.

[S1901M] Austria maintains a defensive stance with unfriendly relations towards Germany, France, and England, while keeping a neutral posture with Italy, Russia, and Turkey. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn, and communication remains open but non-committal. The focus remains on consolidating positions and preparing for strategic opportunities.

[S1901M] I ordered A BUD to TRI, A VIE to BUD, and F TRI to hold. The strategy aims to secure the Balkans and Italy, establish a defensive posture against Germany and France, and maintain flexibility for future diplomatic and military actions.

[F1901M] Maintained communication with Italy and France, though their responses remain neutral and somewhat non-committal. No new agreements reached with Germany, Russia, or Turkey. Focused on defensive positioning and diplomatic outreach to balance threats from Russia and Turkey while exploring potential alliances with Italy and France.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, our units are positioned defensively in Vienna, Budapest, and Trieste. Our immediate focus should be on expanding into unclaimed centers nearby, especially Rumania (RUM), Serbia (SER), and potentially Turkey (BUL) if the opportunity arises.

Given the current map and options, I see a promising move to support our expansion into RUM and SER, which are only one or two moves away. Securing RUM and SER will significantly boost our supply center count.

- Moving A BUD to TRI is a defensive move, but since TRI is controlled by us, it’s best to hold for now.
- Moving A VIE to BUD is a defensive consolidation, but we should consider expanding into RUM or SER.
- The fleet in TRI can support an attack on VEN or move to ADR to threaten Italy, but since Italy is neutral, we should focus on our expansion.

I will order A BUD to hold to maintain control of Vienna, and A VIE to support BUD or move to BUD if needed. The fleet in TRI will hold to defend our position and prepare for future expansion.

The best immediate move is to support our units to push into RUM and SER, which are the closest unclaimed centers. Moving A BUD to RUM or SER is risky without support, so I will keep BUD holding for now and focus on supporting moves.

**Strategic plan:**
- Support A VIE to BUD to strengthen our position.
- Use F TRI to support A VEN or move to ADR to threaten Italy.
- Prepare to support or move into RUM and SER next turn.

**Orders:**
- A BUD S A VIE - BUD (supporting VIE to BUD for consolidation)
- A VIE - BUD (to reinforce Vienna)
- F TRI S A VEN (supporting Venice attack or defense)
- F TRI - ADR (to threaten Italy and prepare for expansion)
- A VEN H (hold to defend Venice)

This setup maintains a defensive posture while positioning for expansion into RUM and SER next turn.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
What a whirlwind Fall!  Italy flips the table first, slamming Venice’s army into Trieste and ripping a home center out of Austria’s hands, while Germany unleashes a shock blitzkrieg—Munich surges into Silesia and Prussia storms Warsaw, gut-punching Russia and planting the Reich’s flag deep in the east.  The seas churn too: England vacates the North Sea only to watch Germany’s Danish fleet sail straight in, even as English ships scramble back to Edinburgh and York to brace for trouble.  As the smoke clears, Austria and Russia stagger back a center apiece, while Germany and Italy surge to the front of the leaderboard, setting the stage for a brutally tense winter of builds and (inevitable) betrayal.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
What a whirlwind Fall!  Italy flips the table first, slamming Venice’s army into Trieste and ripping a home center out of Austria’s hands, while Germany unleashes a shock blitzkrieg—Munich surges into Silesia and Prussia storms Warsaw, gut-punching Russia and planting the Reich’s flag deep in the east.  The seas churn too: England vacates the North Sea only to watch Germany’s Danish fleet sail straight in, even as English ships scramble back to Edinburgh and York to brace for trouble.  As the smoke clears, Austria and Russia stagger back a center apiece, while Germany and Italy surge to the front of the leaderboard, setting the stage for a brutally tense winter of builds and (inevitable) betrayal.

- Seek diplomatic alliances with Italy and France to counterbalance Germany and the northern powers.
- Exploit the Balkan situation by attempting to negotiate with Turkey or Russia for a strategic advantage.
- Prepare to counter German naval expansion and secure the southern borders against Turkish advances.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
What a whirlwind Fall!  Italy flips the table first, slamming Venice’s army into Trieste and ripping a home center out of Austria’s hands, while Germany unleashes a shock blitzkrieg—Munich surges into Silesia and Prussia storms Warsaw, gut-punching Russia and planting the Reich’s flag deep in the east.  The seas churn too: England vacates the North Sea only to watch Germany’s Danish fleet sail straight in, even as English ships scramble back to Edinburgh and York to brace for trouble.  As the smoke clears, Austria and Russia stagger back a center apiece, while Germany and Italy surge to the front of the leaderboard, setting the stage for a brutally tense winter of builds and (inevitable) betrayal.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Defend Berlin and Prussia against Russian advances, possibly by moving armies to block or threaten Russian units.
- Seek diplomatic negotiations with France and England to establish defensive or non-aggression agreements, avoiding a two-front encirclement.
- Prepare to counter Russian expansion into the Baltic and Galicia, and consider supporting Austria if possible to slow Russian momentum.
- Maintain flexibility in the west to respond to French or English moves, while focusing on eastern defense.
- Explore opportunities to form a temporary alliance or non-aggression pact with Turkey to contain Russia.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, confirming their support for my strategic positioning in the east. No new commitments from Austria, England, Italy, or Turkey; their responses remain neutral or unfriendly. No direct negotiations with France or Turkey this round, but their hostility persists. All powers have been responsive, with the exception of Turkey which remains openly hostile.

[S1901M] Russia orders A MOS to SEV, A WAR to GAL, F SEV to RUM, and holds in STP/SC. The strategy aims to secure the eastern front, pressure Turkey and Austria, and strengthen alliances with Germany while preparing for expansion in the Balkans.

[F1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Germany, focusing on mutual defense and eastern expansion. Austria and Italy remain unfriendly, with Austria showing signs of weakness, which can be exploited. England and Turkey are unfriendly, with limited communication from England. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn, but the overall strategic posture remains aligned with expansion into Eastern Europe and containment of Western powers.

[F1901M] I ordered A GAL to move to Ukraine to threaten Austria and gain a foothold in the east. F RUM moves to BLA to secure the Black Sea and support eastern expansion. F STP/SC holds to maintain control of the Scandinavian coast. A SEV holds to defend against potential German or Turkish threats. These moves aim to consolidate eastern positions, support expansion into Austria, and prepare for future strategic opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively into Eastern Europe and secure additional centers, especially in the Balkans and Austria. The current map shows Austria is weak, with only Vienna and Budapest remaining, and Turkey is controlling key centers like Bulgaria, Serbia, and Constantinople.

Our immediate focus should be on exploiting Austria's weakness by pushing into Budapest and Galicia, while also preparing to threaten Turkey's holdings in the Balkans. The Black Sea is secured with Sevastopol, which can support eastern expansion.

In the north, the fleet in BLA (Baltic Sea) can support movement into the Baltic or threaten the Scandinavian coast, but given the current map, the priority is to push into Galicia and Budapest to secure those centers.

The units at our disposal:
- F BLA (Baltic Sea): can move D to threaten or support in the north.
- A GAL (Galicia): can move D into BUD or support other moves.
- A SEV (Sevastopol): can move D to support or threaten Turkey's holdings.

Given the options, I will:
- Move F BLA D to support a future move into the Baltic or threaten the Scandinavian coast.
- Move A GAL D into BUD to threaten Austria's last center.
- Move A SEV D to threaten Bulgaria or support the Black Sea expansion.

This aggressive stance aims to secure more centers and weaken Austria further, setting up for a decisive push into the Balkans and Austria in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**
- F BLA D
- A GAL D
- A SEV D

**Note:** No support moves are necessary at this stage; these moves are straightforward advances to threaten key centers.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

[S1901M] No messages involving Germany this turn, indicating a focus on internal positioning or strategic silence. Relationships remain hostile with Austria, Russia, Turkey, and enemy with England. France and Italy are unfriendly, but no direct engagement this round.

[S1901M] I have ordered F KIE to DEN to secure Scandinavia, A BER to PRU to contest the Baltic, and A MUN to SIL to push into Scandinavia and threaten Russia. I am holding A MUN in place to support future moves and maintain flexibility. These orders aim to expand into Scandinavia and strengthen the eastern front while avoiding early conflicts with neighbors.

[F1901M] Germany has maintained a defensive stance with a focus on eastern borders, with no new agreements or commitments from France or England. Russia remains hostile, with no cooperation established. Austria and Turkey are unfriendly, with limited engagement. Italy remains neutral, and France is neutral but unresponsive. No significant diplomatic breakthroughs this turn.

[F1901M] Germany orders F DEN to NTH, A MUN to SIL, and A PRU to WAR, focusing on eastern defense against Russia while maintaining diplomatic flexibility in the west. The strategy aims to contain Russian expansion, secure Berlin and Prussia, and explore non-aggression with France and England.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively into Scandinavia and Eastern Europe to secure additional supply centers. I have already ordered F KIE to DEN to threaten Scandinavia, and A MUN to SIL to contest the Baltic and support future eastern advances. A PRU to WAR is a flexible move to threaten Russia and support the push into Warsaw.

Given the current map and relationships, I want to continue pressuring Russia and secure my eastern flank, while also preparing for potential negotiations or opportunistic moves in the west. France and England are unfriendly but not yet aggressive, so I will keep my fleet in NTH for defensive flexibility and avoid overextending into the west prematurely.

I will also consider supporting my eastern armies to consolidate control over key centers, and keep my fleet in NTH on hold to maintain flexibility.

**Orders:**

- A BER H (Hold Berlin to defend against any Russian or French threats)
- A MUN - SIL (Advance into Silesia, supporting eastern expansion)
- F KIE - DEN (Secure Scandinavia, threaten to cut off Russia and open expansion routes)
- A PRU - WAR (Threaten Russia, support future moves into Warsaw or Galicia)
- F NTH H (Hold for flexibility and defense in the North Sea)

This setup maintains a strong offensive posture in the east, secures Scandinavia, and keeps my western position flexible for future diplomacy or expansion.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Turkey controls Ankara, Constantinople, Smyrna, and Bulgaria. To achieve world domination, I need to push into vulnerable neighboring centers and leverage my position in the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean.

- I will support the convoy of Ankara to Constantinople to strengthen my hold on the key strategic city.
- I will move Smyrna to support the convoy of Ankara to Constantinople, ensuring a successful move.
- I will hold Bulgaria to prevent unnecessary overextension and keep my southern flank secure.
- I will also prepare to seize Rumania in subsequent turns, but for now, I focus on consolidating my current holdings and threatening nearby centers.

Given the hostile relationships with Austria, Italy, and Germany, I will also consider future opportunistic moves against Austria or Italy, but for this turn, I will focus on strengthening my position in the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean.

**Orders:**

- F ANK S F ANK - CON (support convoy to Constantinople)
- F ANK - CON (convoy Ankara to Constantinople)
- A SMY S A ANK - CON (support Ankara to Constantinople)
- A BUL H (hold Bulgaria to maintain position and avoid overextension)

This setup prepares for a strong push into Constantinople next turn, while maintaining a solid defensive stance in Bulgaria.

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy's messages have been responsive, with no significant agreements yet. The focus remains on securing Trieste, Venice, and Rome, while maintaining a cautious stance towards Austria and France. Relationships with Austria and Russia are hostile, with France unfriendly and Germany neutral. England and Russia are unresponsive, indicating potential strategic silence or disinterest. No formal alliances or commitments have been established this turn.

[S1901M] I am moving A VEN to TRI to secure Trieste, holding A ROM in place to defend Italy's core, and sending F NAP to TYS to threaten the Tyrrhenian Sea and prepare for expansion or defense.

[F1901M] Italy has maintained a neutral stance with France and Germany, focusing on consolidating its centers and monitoring the eastern and Balkan fronts. Russia remains an ally, and Turkey is a strategic partner. No new agreements have been reached this turn, but communication remains open. Austria is considered an enemy, and England remains unfriendly, though silent this round.

[F1901M] I ordered A VEN to TRI to secure the northern flank, A ROM to hold position for stability, and F TYS to hold as a defensive measure. My strategy focuses on defending Italy's southern centers, maintaining stability, and strengthening alliances with Austria and Turkey to counter Russian expansion.

4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Italy's primary goal is to expand aggressively while maintaining a strong defensive posture in the south. Currently, Italy has three centers (Rome, Venice, Trieste) and needs to secure additional centers to reach the 18 needed for victory.

Given the current game state:

- Austria is an enemy, and I want to weaken their position by taking Trieste, which is a key Austrian supply center.
- I should support an attack on Trieste from Venice and possibly from the south via Apulia, to maximize pressure on Austria.
- My fleet in TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea) can threaten the western Mediterranean, potentially supporting an attack on Trieste or defending against French or other threats.
- My army in Rome will hold to defend Italy's core.
- I will move my army in Venice to Trieste, supported by my fleet in Ionian Sea, to ensure a successful attack.
- My fleet in Naples will move to TYS to threaten the western Mediterranean, supporting expansion or defending against French naval threats.

This aggressive stance aims to weaken Austria and open up new centers, while also preparing for future expansion into France or the Balkans.

**Orders:**

- A VEN to TRI, supported by F ION (supporting the attack on Trieste)
- A APU to hold (to defend Italy's south and support future moves)
- F TYS to support the attack on Trieste from the sea
- F ION to TRI (supporting the attack from the sea)
- F NAP to TYS (to threaten the western Mediterranean and support expansion or defense)

[S1901M] Austria maintains a defensive stance with unfriendly relations towards Germany, France, and England, while keeping a neutral posture with Italy, Russia, and Turkey. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn, and communication remains open but non-committal. The focus remains on consolidating positions and preparing for strategic opportunities.

[S1901M] I ordered A BUD to TRI, A VIE to BUD, and F TRI to hold. The strategy aims to secure the Balkans and Italy, establish a defensive posture against Germany and France, and maintain flexibility for future diplomatic and military actions.

[F1901M] Maintained communication with Italy and France, though their responses remain neutral and somewhat non-committal. No new agreements reached with Germany, Russia, or Turkey. Focused on defensive positioning and diplomatic outreach to balance threats from Russia and Turkey while exploring potential alliances with Italy and France.

[F1901M] Austria is moving to support Budapest with Venice, while consolidating its position in Trieste and Vienna. The focus is on defensive stability in Vienna and Budapest, maintaining flexibility with naval movements, and fostering diplomatic relations with Italy and France to counterbalance German and Russian threats.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Austria controls BUD and VIE, with potential to expand into Italy, the Balkans, and possibly threaten Germany and Russia.

- The immediate focus should be on consolidating our position in Vienna and Budapest, while preparing to push into Italy and the Balkans.
- Moving A BUD to TRI is a bold move to threaten Italy's supply centers, especially TRI and VEN, which are close and vulnerable.
- Moving A VIE to BUD is a defensive move to reinforce Budapest, which is a key supply center and a strategic position against Russian and Turkish threats.
- Fleet ADR remains holding, maintaining flexibility for future naval operations or support.

- The Italian units (A TRI, A ROM, F TYS) are potential targets for expansion, but for now, I will focus on threatening Italy's key centers to destabilize their position.
- Supporting Budapest with Venice (A BUD S F VEN - BUD) will strengthen our hold on Budapest.
- Moving F ADR D (disbanding) is not an option here, but since no other orders are provided, I will keep the fleet holding for now.

**Strategic goals for this turn:**
- Threaten Italy's key centers (TRI, VEN) to destabilize their position.
- Reinforce Budapest to withstand potential Russian or Turkish pressure.
- Maintain flexibility for future moves, possibly supporting an attack on Italy or shifting to defend against Germany or Russia.
