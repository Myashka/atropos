gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for AUSTRIA in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

MESSAGES THIS ROUND
(No messages involving your power this round that require deep reflection for diary. Focus on overall situation.)


All powers have been responsive to your messages.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
[""Secure and expand in Western Europe by establishing a strong presence in France and Belgium, potentially through early diplomatic agreements or coordinated moves."", ""Build a naval and land presence in Scandinavia and the North Sea to threaten Germany and Russia, aiming to control key supply centers and choke points."", ""Form a flexible alliance with France and potentially Russia to counter German and Austrian expansion, while remaining prepared to shift alliances as the game develops.""]

Relationships:
{""FRANCE"": ""Friendly"", ""GERMANY"": ""Unfriendly"", ""RUSSIA"": ""Neutral"", ""AUSTRIA"": ""Unfriendly"", ""TURKEY"": ""Unfriendly""}

Game State:
Units: {'AUSTRIA': ['A BUD', 'A VIE', 'F TRI'], 'ENGLAND': ['F EDI', 'F LON', 'A LVP'], 'FRANCE': ['F BRE', 'A MAR', 'A PAR'], 'GERMANY': ['F KIE', 'A BER', 'A MUN'], 'ITALY': ['F NAP', 'A ROM', 'A VEN'], 'RUSSIA': ['A WAR', 'A MOS', 'F SEV', 'F STP/SC'], 'TURKEY': ['F ANK', 'A CON', 'A SMY']}, Centers: {'AUSTRIA': ['BUD', 'TRI', 'VIE'], 'ENGLAND': ['EDI', 'LON', 'LVP'], 'FRANCE': ['BRE', 'MAR', 'PAR'], 'GERMANY': ['BER', 'KIE', 'MUN'], 'ITALY': ['NAP', 'ROM', 'VEN'], 'RUSSIA': ['MOS', 'SEV', 'STP', 'WAR'], 'TURKEY': ['ANK', 'CON', 'SMY']}

TASK
Analyze the negotiations, goals, relationships, and game state to:
1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements
2. State your strategic intent for S1901M
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

{""negotiation_summary"": ""Key outcomes from negotiations"",""intent"": ""Strategic intent for upcoming orders"",""updated_relationships"": {
""POWER_NAME"": ""Enemy|Unfriendly|Neutral|Friendly|Ally""
}
}

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure key supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. We need to push into unclaimed centers like RUM, ANK, and BUL, which are close and accessible.

- The most immediate opportunity is to take RUM, which is only two moves away via SEV. Moving F SEV to RUM will secure a valuable center in the Black Sea region, strengthening our position in the east.
- Supporting this move with F SEV S A BUD - RUM is a good idea, as BUD is controlled by Austria and is a potential threat. We can threaten Austria's position and weaken their hold in the region.
- Moving A WAR to UKR is a strategic move to threaten Austria and potentially cut off their access to the south, while also positioning for future expansion into the Balkans.
- Moving A MOS to LVN is a bold move to threaten Germany's nearby centers and open a new front, especially since Germany is friendly and unlikely to oppose this move.
- Holding A MOS (H) is an option if we want to consolidate, but given our aggressive stance, moving it to LVN or UKR is preferable.
- Moving A WAR to UKR and F SEV to RUM are the most impactful moves to expand our influence and threaten Austria and Turkey.

This plan aims to secure RUM quickly, threaten Austria's centers, and position for further expansion into the Balkans and the Middle East.

**Orders:**

- F SEV S A BUD - RUM (support move to take RUM)
- F SEV - ARM (move to threaten Turkey)
- A WAR - UKR (advance into Ukraine, threaten Austria)
- A MOS - LVN (expand into the Baltic region, threaten Germany)
- A WAR H (hold to consolidate position)

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia, while maintaining a strategic alliance with Russia to counter Austria and other powers. Currently, Turkey controls ANK, CON, and SMY, with potential to push into Bulgaria (BUL) and Rumelia (RUM). The immediate focus should be on securing and expanding into these nearby centers, especially BUL and RUM, which are only two moves away.

Given the map and options, I will:

- Use F ANK to move into CON, aiming to secure the coast and threaten Bulgaria.
- Use A CON to support the move into BUL, aiming to take control of Bulgaria, a key strategic center.
- Use F SMY to support F ANK into CON, ensuring the move succeeds.
- Keep F SEV and A SMY on hold for now, as they are not immediately useful for expansion this turn.
- Maintain flexibility to respond to Russian moves or threats from Austria.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia quickly, which are critical for reaching 18 centers. Supporting the move into BUL with CON and ANK will help us expand into the Balkans, and controlling Bulgaria will be a significant step toward domination.

**Orders:**

- F ANK - CON
- A CON - BUL
- F SMY S F ANK - CON
- F SEV H
- A SMY H

This plan supports a swift expansion into Bulgaria, leveraging Turkey’s position as a bridge between the Middle East and Europe, and sets the stage for further expansion into Rumelia and Greece in subsequent turns.

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Italy to secure additional supply centers. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with RUM, SER, and BUL as the nearest uncontrolled centers. The immediate focus should be on consolidating our holdings and pushing into RUM and SER, which are only one move away, to increase our supply centers.

Germany is friendly, which is advantageous for a coordinated expansion into the Balkans and Italy. Italy remains unfriendly, but we can leverage our position to threaten or pressure Italy into concessions, especially in Venice and Trieste.

Our units are well-positioned to push into RUM and SER. Moving A BUD to SER and A VIE to GAL will threaten Russia and open up new frontiers. F TRI can support moves into VEN or hold to defend Trieste.

Given the current map, I will:
- Support A BUD S A VIE - GAL to threaten or take Galicia.
- Move A VIE to GAL to threaten or take Galicia.
- Support F TRI S A VEN - TRI to reinforce the attack on Venice.
- Hold A ROM to maintain pressure on Italy.
- Move F NAP to TYS to threaten or support an attack on Venice or defend against Italian fleets.

This plan aims to expand into RUM and SER, threaten Italy's holdings, and prepare for further expansion into the Balkans and Italy.

- A BUD S A VIE - GAL

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate focus is on consolidating control of Italy’s core centers (NAP, ROM, VEN) and expanding strategically to secure additional supply centers. France remains friendly, which is advantageous for a potential alliance or at least a non-aggression stance, while Austria, Germany, Russia, and Turkey are hostile, so we must be cautious and opportunistic.

Currently, our units are positioned defensively, but we should look to expand into nearby centers like TRI, BUD, and potentially TUN or GRE in the future. The most immediate threat is Austria’s F TRI, which is adjacent to VEN and ROM, and Austria’s overall unfriendly stance suggests we should prepare to challenge or defend against their expansion.

In this phase, I will:
- Support the move of VEN to TRI to threaten Austria’s TRI and potentially force a retreat or gain a foothold.
- Use ROM to support VEN or prepare for a move to BUD if Austria weakens.
- Keep NAP and VEN flexible, with the possibility of supporting each other or attacking Austria’s centers.
- Prepare to move NAP to TYS if the opportunity arises, or hold to defend against French or Austrian threats.
- Maintain a defensive stance for now, but with an eye toward aggressive expansion in the next turn.

**Orders:**
- A VEN S A ROM - TRI (supporting VEN to attack TRI, threatening Austria’s key center)
- A ROM S A VEN - TRI (supporting VEN to attack TRI)
- F NAP - TYS (preparing to move fleet to TYS for future expansion or defense)
- A NAP H (hold to maintain position)
- F ION - AEG (to threaten Greece and open future expansion routes)

**Note:** The orders are based on the current map and strategic goals, aiming to pressure Austria and expand Italy’s influence.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, England controls London, Edinburgh, and Liverpool, with potential to expand into Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia.

- The immediate focus should be on taking the nearby unclaimed centers: Belgium, Holland, and Denmark, which are within reach and critical for expansion.
- Our fleet in Edinburgh (F EDI) can support moves into North Sea (NTH) or YOR, or convoy into Belgium or Holland if needed.
- Our fleet in London (F LON) can support or move into the North Sea or YOR, or support an attack on Belgium.
- Our army in Liverpool (A LVP) can move to support or threaten Belgium or Holland, or reposition to threaten Scandinavia.
- Since France is friendly, we can coordinate to avoid conflict in the West and focus on the North Sea and Scandinavia.
- Germany is hostile, so we should be prepared to defend against their expansion, especially into Denmark or the North Sea.
- Russia and Turkey are neutral, but we should keep an eye on the North and East for potential threats.

Order-wise, I will:
- Move F EDI to NTH to threaten Germany and support future moves into Belgium or Holland.
- Move F LON to YOR to threaten or support an attack into Belgium.
- Support Liverpool's army into Belgium if needed.
- Use Liverpool to support or move into Belgium or Holland.
- Prepare to convoy or support into Denmark if the opportunity arises.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark early, setting the stage for further expansion into Scandinavia and the Continent.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control Berlin, Kiel, and Munich. I need to push outward to gain more centers, especially in the north and east, while maintaining a strong defensive posture at home.

- **Kiel (KIE):** I will move F KIE to DEN to threaten the Scandinavian centers and open a route toward the north. Securing Denmark is crucial for expansion and naval dominance.
- **Berlin (BER):** I will support MUN to move into Kiel, reinforcing my northern flank and preparing for future expansion.
- **Munich (MUN):** I will move A MUN to BOH to threaten Austria and open a new front, or alternatively, support a move into Tyrolia if needed later.
- **Army in MUN:** I will support A BER to KIE to ensure the move succeeds and to threaten the Scandinavian and northern centers.
- **Fleet in KIE:** I will move F KIE to DEN to threaten the Scandinavian centers and prepare for future expansion.
- **Support moves:** I will support MUN to BOH to threaten Austria and prepare for potential future moves into Austria or Italy.
- **Support at home:** Hold in Berlin and Munich to consolidate my position.

This plan aims to push into Scandinavia and the north, threaten Austria and France, and position myself for rapid expansion in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- F KIE - DEN
- A BER S A MUN - BOH
- A MUN S A BER - KIE
- A MUN - BOH
- A BER - KIE
- F HEL H (Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense)
- A BER H (Hold Berlin for now, but ready to support KIE or move if opportunity arises)

**Note:** I will keep my options flexible for future turns, considering potential alliances or betrayals to maximize expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with Turkey seizing Bulgaria while Russia’s fleet darts to Armenia, the Black Sea front instantly primed for carnage. Austria doubles down, ramming two armies into Galicia and daring the Tsar to blink, as Italy’s lone fleet slips into the Tyrrhenian to watch the sparks fly. Germany goes full throttle—Munich punches into Bohemia and Kiel sails to Denmark—just as England’s North Sea scheme fizzles, leaving the Channel powers eyeing each other warily. No centers have fallen yet, but the powder kegs are stacked and every alliance is now a hair-trigger away from betrayal when the Fall fires begin.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with Turkey seizing Bulgaria while Russia’s fleet darts to Armenia, the Black Sea front instantly primed for carnage. Austria doubles down, ramming two armies into Galicia and daring the Tsar to blink, as Italy’s lone fleet slips into the Tyrrhenian to watch the sparks fly. Germany goes full throttle—Munich punches into Bohemia and Kiel sails to Denmark—just as England’s North Sea scheme fizzles, leaving the Channel powers eyeing each other warily. No centers have fallen yet, but the powder kegs are stacked and every alliance is now a hair-trigger away from betrayal when the Fall fires begin.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand influence in the Balkans and Anatolia by establishing control over key supply centers such as Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Greece, while maintaining flexibility to respond to neighboring threats.
- Build a strategic alliance with Russia to counter Austria and Germany, focusing on mutual support and coordinated expansion into Central Europe and the Black Sea region.
- Leverage Turkey’s position as a bridge between Europe and the Middle East to threaten Italy and France, aiming to secure control over the Mediterranean and expand into Italy’s southern centers.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with Turkey seizing Bulgaria while Russia’s fleet darts to Armenia, the Black Sea front instantly primed for carnage. Austria doubles down, ramming two armies into Galicia and daring the Tsar to blink, as Italy’s lone fleet slips into the Tyrrhenian to watch the sparks fly. Germany goes full throttle—Munich punches into Bohemia and Kiel sails to Denmark—just as England’s North Sea scheme fizzles, leaving the Channel powers eyeing each other warily. No centers have fallen yet, but the powder kegs are stacked and every alliance is now a hair-trigger away from betrayal when the Fall fires begin.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in the Balkans and Italy to gain early supply centers.
- Establish a strong position against Turkey and Italy while maintaining flexibility with Germany and Russia.
- Form a strategic alliance with Germany to contain Russia and France, while preparing for potential conflicts with Turkey and Italy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Germany's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure as many supply centers as possible. Currently, our units are positioned defensively in Berlin, Kiel, and Munich, but we need to shift toward expansion.

- The most immediate opportunity is to take Denmark (DEN), a key neutral supply center that is only two moves away from Berlin via support from Kiel or from Denmark itself. Securing DEN will give us a crucial step toward 18 centers.
- Moving F DEN to SKA (South Coast of Scandinavia) is a good move to threaten Scandinavia and potentially support future expansion into Norway or Sweden.
- Moving A BER to PRU (Prussia) is a strategic move to threaten Russia and gain control of a nearby supply center, especially as Russia is an enemy and overextension in the east is likely.
- Moving A BOH to VIE (Vienna) is an aggressive move to threaten Austria, exploiting their overextension in Galicia and potentially forcing Austria to divert units or lose control of Vienna.
- Supporting moves are not necessary at this stage; we want to focus on aggressive positioning.

This plan aims to secure DEN early, threaten Russia and Austria, and set the stage for further expansion in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**

- F DEN - SKA
- A BER - PRU
- A BOH - VIE
- Support moves are not necessary this turn; focus on these aggressive advances.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, securing their support for a strategic alliance. Italy remains unfriendly, with limited communication. Russia and Turkey are hostile, with no recent responses, indicating potential threats. No new agreements reached with England or France, both of whom are unfriendly and unresponsive. Austria's position is focused on consolidating Balkan and Italian holdings.

[S1901M] I ordered A VIE to support GAL to strengthen my position in the Balkans, and A BUD to move to GAL for expansion. F TRI is held in place to maintain flexibility and defend against potential threats.

[F1901M] Austria has maintained a defensive stance, focusing on strengthening Galicia and VIE while engaging diplomatically with Germany and Turkey. No formal agreements have been reached, but communication remains open. Relationships with neighbors remain hostile, with no significant breakthroughs. Italy and Russia continue to be perceived as threats, and Turkey is viewed as an adversary in the Balkans.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, our holdings are BUD, TRI, and VIE. Our immediate focus should be on consolidating our position in the Balkans and expanding into nearby centers, especially RUM and SER, which are close and accessible.

- BUD is well-positioned to support moves into RUM or SER, and I want to push into RUM to gain a vital eastern supply center.
- GAL is a key strategic position; moving into WAR or RUM will help us threaten Russia and secure more centers.
- TRI is held by our fleet; I will keep it in place to maintain flexibility and threaten Italy or support future expansion into the Tyrrhenian.
- VIE is a stronghold, but I should consider expanding into BUD or supporting BUD to push into RUM.

Given the current options, I will:
- Support BUD to move into RUM, gaining a crucial eastern center.
- Support GAL to move into WAR, threatening Russia and potentially forcing a Russian response.
- Hold TRI to maintain flexibility.
- Keep VIE in place for defense and future support.

This approach balances expansion into RUM and pressure on Russia, while maintaining defensive flexibility.

**Orders:**
- A BUD S A GAL - WAR (support GAL to move into WAR)

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [

    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Black Sea region, leveraging our friendly relations with Russia to secure the Black Sea and Balkan centers. Our units are positioned well to threaten Bulgaria, Rumelia, and potentially push into Greece or further into the Balkans.

Given the current map and options, I will:

- Use the fleet in CON to threaten Bulgaria and Rumelia, aiming to secure or pressure these centers.
- Support the army in Smyrna to move into Bulgaria or Rumelia, depending on Russian cooperation.
- Keep options open for future expansion into Greece or further into the Balkans.
- Maintain a flexible stance with the army in Smyrna, ready to support or defend as needed.
- Support the army in Bulgaria to move into Rumelia or hold, depending on Russian moves.
- Hold units in Smyrna and Bulgaria to consolidate position and prepare for future expansion.

This approach aims to secure key Balkan centers early, build a foothold for further expansion, and keep options open for attacking Italy or Austria later.

**Orders:**

- F CON S A SMY - BUL (support Smyrna to move into Bulgaria, pressuring or securing the center)
- A BUL S A SMY - RUM (support Smyrna to move into Rumelia, aiming to take or pressure Rumelia)
- A SMY - BUL (attack Bulgaria, supported by CON)
- A SMY S F CON - BLA (support fleet in CON to threaten BLA, controlling access to the Black Sea)
- F ANK - CON (move to support the fleet in CON or threaten the Black Sea)
- Hold units in Smyrna and Bulgaria to maintain flexibility

This plan aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia early, leverage Russian cooperation, and set the stage for further expansion into Greece and the Balkans.

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is RUSSIA. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: RUSSIA
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and defend BUD, SEV, and WAR to establish control over key Eastern European and Black Sea centers.
- Coordinate with Germany to contain France and Italy, possibly preparing for a joint effort against Austria or Turkey.
- Advance fleet to Armenia to threaten Turkey's holdings and support Balkan influence.
- Monitor Austria's movements in Galicia and prepare to counter or negotiate accordingly.
- Strengthen alliance with Germany to balance against Austria and Turkey, while remaining flexible for future shifts.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Enemy
- GERMANY: Friendly
- ITALY: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Enemy

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, confirming their support for my strategic positioning in the East. No new commitments from Austria, England, France, Italy, or Turkey; all remain unresponsive or hostile. Focused on consolidating control over key Russian centers and preparing for potential conflicts with Turkey and Austria.

[S1901M] Russia orders F SEV to support BUD in moving towards Rum, F SEV to continue in arm, A WAR to move into Ukraine, A MOS to move into Latvia, A WAR to hold position, and StP/SC to hold. The strategic intent is to strengthen eastern positions, support expansion into BUD and Rum, and prepare for potential conflicts with Austria, Turkey, and Italy while maintaining a friendly stance with Germany.

[F1901M] No messages involving Russia this turn, but overall, Russia maintains a strong position with units in WAR, SEV, STP, and ARM. Relations with Germany are friendly, supporting cooperation in the East. Austria remains unfriendly, likely to be a threat in Galicia. France and Italy are enemies, with France possibly preparing for aggressive moves in the West. Turkey is an enemy, with a focus on the Black Sea and the Balkans. England is neutral, and other powers are engaged in their own strategic pursuits.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure key centers to reach 18 supply centers. Currently, I control four centers: WAR, SEV, STP, and MOS. I need to push into Austria, Turkey, and potentially threaten Western Europe to gain more centers.

- The Black Sea (SEV) is a strategic position to threaten Turkey and support future expansion into the Balkans.
- Moving F ARM to ANK is a bold move to threaten Turkey’s key supply center and open a new front.
- Supporting BUD and Rum from SEV and ARM will help secure these critical centers and prepare for further expansion.
- The army in WAR should support the move into Galicia (GAL) to threaten Austria’s eastern flank and potentially take BUD or Galicia.
- The LVN army can support WAR into GAL or move to PRU to threaten Germany’s eastern flank, increasing pressure on Central Europe.
- The fleet in STP/SC can support the move into BLA or hold to threaten the Mediterranean or support other moves.

This aggressive stance aims to destabilize Austria and Turkey, seize BUD, and threaten Turkey’s holdings, while also preparing for future expansion into the Balkans and Central Europe.

**Orders:**

- F ARM - ANK
- A WAR - GAL
- A LVN - PRU
- F STP/SC - BLA
- A BUD S A GAL - BUD
- A GAL S A WAR - GAL

**Note:** Support moves are designed to strengthen the push into Galicia and BUD, while the fleet supports BLA to threaten Turkey’s Black Sea coast.

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, focusing on consolidating control of NAP, ROM, and VEN. No new agreements have been made, and other powers remain unresponsive or hostile. Austria and Germany are unfriendly, Russia is unfriendly, and Turkey is unfriendly, indicating a challenging diplomatic environment. Italy's units are positioned defensively, with no immediate threats from neighbors.

[S1901M] I ordered F NAP to move to TYS to secure the Tyrrhenian Sea, while both A ROM and A VEN are on hold to maintain flexibility and avoid early conflicts. The strategy focuses on consolidating Italy's core, avoiding immediate confrontation with Austria and Germany, and positioning for future expansion and alliance opportunities.

[F1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, focusing on securing Trieste, Venice, and Rome. No new agreements have been made this turn, but communication remains open. Austria remains unfriendly, and Germany and Russia are unfriendly, indicating potential threats. England is neutral, and Turkey is unfriendly, but no direct negotiations are ongoing with them this round.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand Italy’s control over supply centers to reach 18 and secure world domination. Currently, I control NAP, ROM, and VEN, which are vital to my core. I want to leverage my friendly relationship with France to avoid a two-front war, while preparing to take advantage of Austria’s hostility and Germany’s unfriendly stance.

In this phase, I will focus on consolidating my position and preparing for expansion into Austria’s vulnerable centers, especially TRI and BUD, which are close and accessible. Moving A ROM to TUS via support from VEN will threaten Trieste, forcing Austria to respond. Supporting the move from VEN to TRI with A VEN will help secure Trieste, a key target.

F TYS will move to Ionian Sea to threaten or support future operations into Greece or the Balkans, while F TYS supports the move to NAP to secure my southern flank and prepare for future expansion into Tunisia or the Mediterranean.

I will hold A VEN to support the attack on TRI, and F TYS will move to Ionian to threaten Greece or support future moves. This positions me for a strong push into Austria’s centers next turn, while maintaining flexibility.

**Goals for this move:**
- Secure Trieste and BUD by pressuring Austria.
- Maintain a friendly stance with France.
- Position fleets for future expansion into the Mediterranean and Balkans.
- Keep Germany and Russia at bay, avoiding early conflict.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, England controls London, Edinburgh, and Liverpool, totaling 3 centers. We need to seize opportunities to expand into unclaimed or weakly defended centers, especially in the Low Countries and Scandinavia, while maintaining control of the North Sea and Channel.

- The immediate focus is on securing the North Sea and Channel approaches to prevent German dominance and prepare for expansion into Belgium and Holland.
- Our fleet in Edinburgh (F EDI) is well-positioned to support moves into the North Sea (NTH) or to threaten Denmark (DEN) and the Baltic.
- The fleet in YOR (F YOR) can support EDI or move into the North Sea as well.
- The army in Liverpool (A LVP) can support YOR or move into Wales (WAL) to threaten or secure that area.
- We should aim to take Belgium (BEL) and Holland (HOL) in subsequent turns, as they are key to expanding into the Low Countries.
- Maintaining friendly relations with France is crucial; we should avoid provoking them unnecessarily and consider future cooperation.
- Germany remains hostile, so we should be prepared for potential conflict or defensive positioning.
- Russia and Turkey are neutral, but we should keep an eye on their movements for future opportunistic expansion.

Orders will focus on consolidating control of the North Sea and Channel, supporting YOR to move into the North Sea, and preparing to push into Belgium and Holland next turn.

**Orders:**

- F EDI S F YOR - NTH (support YOR into North Sea, threatening German and Scandinavian expansion)
- F YOR S F EDI - NTH (support EDI into North Sea, reinforcing control)
- A LVP - WAL (advance into Wales to threaten or secure that region)
- F YOR - NTH (move into North Sea to contest German control and prepare for expansion)
- A LVP S F YOR - NTH (support LVP into North Sea if needed, or hold to support future moves)
