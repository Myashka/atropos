intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).
