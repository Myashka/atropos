atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL
  Austria
    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest
    - Marseilles

    - Saint Petersburg
    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

gpt-4o-mini,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste

    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Venice and the Adriatic Sea to threaten Austria and gain access to the Balkans.
- I will move my army from Rome (A ROM) to Venice (A VEN) to secure that supply center.
- The fleet in Naples (F NAP) will move to the Adriatic Sea (F NAP - APU) to establish control over the sea and support future moves against Austria or Turkey.
- I will hold the army in Venice (A VEN H) to ensure it remains secure after the move from Rome.
- This strategy allows me to establish a strong foothold in the region while preparing for future expansion towards Austria and Turkey.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

gpt-4o-mini,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Rumania (RUM) and Bulgaria (BUL) to strengthen my position in the Balkans. I will move my fleet from Sevastopol (SEV) to Rumania, which is a critical supply center that I can capture this turn.
- I will also move my army from Warsaw (WAR) to Ukraine (UKR) to position myself for future moves towards both Rumania and potentially Austria's centers.
- The army in Moscow (MOS) will support the move to Rumania from Sevastopol, ensuring that I can capture it without interference.
- I will hold my units in Moscow and Warsaw to maintain a strong defensive position while I expand.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Boom—Spring 1901 explodes as the Balkans become a mosh-pit: Russia lunges into Rumania, Turkey counters by storming Bulgaria, and Austria double-stabs the region with armies in Serbia and Galicia, setting up a three-way knife-fight for the fall builds! In the north, the North Sea turns into a white-capped traffic jam, with England’s twin fleets slamming into a German wall and bouncing hard while Kaiser Wilhelm slips a cheeky fleet into Denmark for Germany’s first grab. France and Italy glare across the Alps but hold fire, Rome’s probe at Venice rebuffed, while St. Petersburg, Paris, and Moscow sit eerily quiet—coiled springs for the next strike. Momentum now tilts toward the Eastern Triangle, where one mis-order could spark the game’s first betrayal and redraw the map overnight!

Board State:


PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Boom—Spring 1901 explodes as the Balkans become a mosh-pit: Russia lunges into Rumania, Turkey counters by storming Bulgaria, and Austria double-stabs the region with armies in Serbia and Galicia, setting up a three-way knife-fight for the fall builds! In the north, the North Sea turns into a white-capped traffic jam, with England’s twin fleets slamming into a German wall and bouncing hard while Kaiser Wilhelm slips a cheeky fleet into Denmark for Germany’s first grab. France and Italy glare across the Alps but hold fire, Rome’s probe at Venice rebuffed, while St. Petersburg, Paris, and Moscow sit eerily quiet—coiled springs for the next strike. Momentum now tilts toward the Eastern Triangle, where one mis-order could spark the game’s first betrayal and redraw the map overnight!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure control of the North Sea and the English Channel to enhance naval mobility and pressure on France and Germany.
- Establish a strong alliance with either France or Germany to counterbalance the threat from Russia and Austria.
- Expand into Scandinavia by targeting Norway and Sweden, while keeping an eye on Russia's movements.

[S1901M] Turkey is seeking to establish a foothold in the Balkans and has communicated with Russia about coordinating efforts against Austria. Russia has expressed a desire for a peaceful relationship and requested assurance regarding Turkey's plans in the region. Austria has not responded to Turkey's proposal for a non-aggression pact, indicating potential hostility. Italy is looking for cooperation in the Mediterranean but has not engaged directly with Turkey. England remains neutral and open to alliances.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria for expansion and strengthen ties with Russia while preparing for potential aggression against Austria.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Engaged in discussions with Austria about a potential alliance to counter Russian influence, and with England regarding cooperation in the North Sea. France has been informed of my intentions to secure Belgium and Denmark, seeking a non-aggression pact. Italy has been approached for potential cooperation, but has not responded. Russia is open to maintaining peaceful coexistence. Overall, relationships with Austria and England are positive, while France and Russia remain unfriendly.

[S1901M] Germany has ordered its fleet in Kiel to move to Denmark, while the armies in Munich and Berlin will hold their positions. The goal is to secure Denmark for a stronger northern presence and to prepare for potential conflicts with France, while maintaining a friendly relationship with Austria.

[S1901M] Austria is seeking cooperation in the Balkans and has expressed a desire for peace, while Germany is interested in a balanced approach against Austria. France has not responded to my proposal for cooperation against Austria. Turkey is also looking to establish a foothold in the Balkans. I have communicated my intentions to secure Venice and the Adriatic Sea, but responses from France and Turkey are pending.

[S1901M] Moved Army from Rome to Venice, Fleet from Naples to Apulia, and held Army in Venice. The intent is to secure Venice and the Adriatic Sea, positioning for potential expansion into the Balkans while assessing opportunities for alliances, particularly with France against Austria and Germany.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Engaged in discussions with France about a potential alliance to secure the North Sea and English Channel. Germany expressed interest in cooperation regarding Denmark, while Russia proposed a non-aggression pact. Austria and Turkey are focused on the Balkans, and Italy is looking to establish a foothold in the Mediterranean. France has not responded to my messages, indicating possible indifference or prioritization of other relationships.

[S1901M] Moved fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, while holding the army in Liverpool. This positions England for control of the North Sea and potential pressure on France and Germany, while also preparing for future expansion into Scandinavia.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello Russia, I appreciate your proposal to work together against Turkey. I believe securing Rumania is crucial for both of us. I am willing to support your move into Rumania if you can assist me in securing Bulgaria. Let's coordinate our efforts to strengthen our positions in the Balkans.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Hi Russia, I appreciate your proposal for a non-aggression pact. Given our current positions, it seems wise to avoid conflict while we both focus on our respective fronts. I am open to this agreement, but I would like to keep communication open to ensure we can address any future developments.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Greetings Russia, I appreciate your outreach. I agree that maintaining open lines of communication is crucial. While I am focused on the west, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to avoid conflict in the early stages. Let's keep our borders secure and perhaps explore opportunities for cooperation in the future.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  RUSSIA: Hello Turkey, I appreciate your interest in coordinating efforts in the Balkans. However, I must express my concern about your intentions towards Bulgaria. I believe it would be more beneficial for both of us to focus on countering Austria's influence together. Perhaps we can agree to support each other in our respective territories while keeping an eye on Austria's movements?
  TURKEY: Hi Russia, I appreciate your focus on securing your borders. I assure you that I have no intentions of interfering with your plans in Rumania and Bulgaria. In fact, I believe we can work together to apply pressure on Austria. Let's coordinate our efforts to ensure we both benefit from our expansion in the Balkans.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  RUSSIA: Hi Italy, I see you are looking to establish a foothold in the Mediterranean. While my focus is primarily on the Balkans and the North, I believe we could find common ground. If you can keep Austria occupied in the Adriatic, I can assist by applying pressure from the north. Let's discuss how we can mutually benefit from our positions.

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW",,Failure: No moves extracted
gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy is open to coexistence but is focused on securing Venice and the Adriatic Sea. Germany is interested in a neutral stance and potential cooperation against Russia. Russia proposes a joint effort to counter Turkey's influence in the Balkans. Turkey suggests a non-aggression pact to avoid conflict in the region. Overall, there is a mix of potential alliances and neutral stances, with Italy being the most friendly towards Austria.

[S1901M] Moved Army from Budapest to Serbia, Army from Vienna to Galicia, and held Fleet in Trieste. Aiming to secure Serbia for expansion and strengthen position in the Balkans while maintaining a friendly relationship with Italy.

[F1901M] Engaged with Russia to coordinate efforts against Turkey, proposing mutual support for securing Rumania and Bulgaria. Communicated with Turkey about a non-aggression pact but expressed concerns over their intentions in the Balkans. Italy is open to discussions, indicating a friendly stance. No responses from Russia and Turkey to my proposals, which may indicate their prioritization of other relationships or a lack of commitment.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

gpt-4o-mini,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Austria is seeking cooperation in the Balkans and has expressed a desire for peace, while Germany is interested in a balanced approach against Austria. France has not responded to my proposal for cooperation against Austria. Turkey is also looking to establish a foothold in the Balkans. I have communicated my intentions to secure Venice and the Adriatic Sea, but responses from France and Turkey are pending.

[S1901M] Moved Army from Rome to Venice, Fleet from Naples to Apulia, and held Army in Venice. The intent is to secure Venice and the Adriatic Sea, positioning for potential expansion into the Balkans while assessing opportunities for alliances, particularly with France against Austria and Germany.

[F1901M] Italy is focused on securing the Adriatic Sea and has expressed interest in forming alliances with France and Turkey to counter Austria. Austria is seeking cooperation in the Balkans, while Russia is looking to secure Rumania and apply pressure on Austria. Germany has proposed a non-aggression pact, and England is open to cooperation in the Mediterranean. However, France has not responded to Italy's proposals, indicating a potential lack of interest or other priorities.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Hello Italy, I appreciate your interest in establishing a foothold in the Mediterranean. While my focus is primarily on the North Sea and countering Germany's naval presence, I believe we could find common ground. If you are open to discussing potential cooperation, I would be interested in exploring how we can mutually benefit from our respective strategies.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hello Italy, I appreciate your interest in establishing a strong foothold in the Mediterranean. While my focus is currently on securing Belgium and Denmark, I believe we could benefit from a non-aggression pact in our respective regions. This would allow us to focus on our goals without stepping on each other's toes. Let's discuss how we can support each other's ambitions.
  ITALY: Hello Germany! I appreciate your interest in maintaining stability in Central Europe. I agree that a balanced approach towards Austria could be beneficial for both of us. Let's discuss how we can coordinate our efforts effectively.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ITALY: Bonjour! I believe we share a common interest in countering Austria's ambitions in the region. I propose we discuss a potential alliance to secure our positions and possibly target Austria together. Let me know your thoughts!

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Engaged in discussions with Austria about a potential alliance to counter Russian influence, and with England regarding cooperation in the North Sea. France has been informed of my intentions to secure Belgium and Denmark, seeking a non-aggression pact. Italy has been approached for potential cooperation, but has not responded. Russia is open to maintaining peaceful coexistence. Overall, relationships with Austria and England are positive, while France and Russia remain unfriendly.

[S1901M] Germany has ordered its fleet in Kiel to move to Denmark, while the armies in Munich and Berlin will hold their positions. The goal is to secure Denmark for a stronger northern presence and to prepare for potential conflicts with France, while maintaining a friendly relationship with Austria.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Italy about a non-aggression pact, which they agreed could be beneficial. Communicated with Russia to maintain open lines and avoid early conflict, but they remain an enemy. Turkey expressed interest in the Balkans, and I proposed mutual respect for territories. Austria is friendly, and I aim to solidify this relationship to counter Russian influence. France has not responded to my outreach, indicating potential hostility.

 TURKEY: To all powers: Turkey is looking to solidify its position in the Balkans and is open to discussions regarding potential alliances or cooperation. I believe that a united front can lead to mutual benefits for all involved.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ITALY:
  GERMANY: Hello Italy, I appreciate your interest in establishing a strong foothold in the Mediterranean. While my focus is currently on securing Belgium and Denmark, I believe we could benefit from a non-aggression pact in our respective regions. This would allow us to focus on our goals without stepping on each other's toes. Let's discuss how we can support each other's ambitions.
  ITALY: Hello Germany! I appreciate your interest in maintaining stability in Central Europe. I agree that a balanced approach towards Austria could be beneficial for both of us. Let's discuss how we can coordinate our efforts effectively.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  GERMANY: Greetings Russia, I appreciate your outreach. I agree that maintaining open lines of communication is crucial. While I am focused on the west, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to avoid conflict in the early stages. Let's keep our borders secure and perhaps explore opportunities for cooperation in the future.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  GERMANY: Hello Turkey, I see you are looking to establish a foothold in the Balkans. While my focus is primarily on Northern Europe, I am open to discussing potential cooperation. If we can agree to respect each other's territories, it could lead to mutual benefits. Let's keep the lines of communication open.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Belgium (BEL) and Denmark (DEN) to strengthen my position in Northern Europe. Securing these supply centers early will help me expand my influence and resources.
- The fleet in Kiel (F KIE) will move to Denmark (DEN) to secure it, while the army in Munich (A MUN) will hold to protect my home centers and support future moves.
- The army in Berlin (A BER) will move to Munich (MUN) to ensure that I have a stronghold in the center of my territory and can support future operations.
- I will also consider the potential threat from France and ensure that I have a defensive posture while maintaining a friendly relationship with Austria.

gpt-4o-mini,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is ENGLAND. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: ENGLAND
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure control of the North Sea and English Channel to counter Germany's naval presence.
- Establish a diplomatic dialogue with Turkey to explore potential cooperation.
- Monitor Russia's movements and prepare to counter their expansion into Scandinavia.
- Consider a strategic alliance with France to balance against Germany's aggression.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Neutral
- FRANCE: Unfriendly
- GERMANY: Enemy
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Enemy
- TURKEY: Neutral

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Engaged in discussions with France about a potential alliance to secure the North Sea and English Channel. Germany expressed interest in cooperation regarding Denmark, while Russia proposed a non-aggression pact. Austria and Turkey are focused on the Balkans, and Italy is looking to establish a foothold in the Mediterranean. France has not responded to my messages, indicating possible indifference or prioritization of other relationships.

[S1901M] Moved fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, while holding the army in Liverpool. This positions England for control of the North Sea and potential pressure on France and Germany, while also preparing for future expansion into Scandinavia.

[F1901M] Engaged in discussions with Italy about potential cooperation in the Mediterranean, but received no response. Established a non-aggression pact with Russia, though they have not confirmed. Initiated dialogue with Turkey regarding mutual interests in the Balkans, but no response yet. Austria is seeking stability in the Balkans, while Germany remains a primary concern. France has not engaged in any discussions.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure control of the North Sea and the English Channel to counter Germany's naval presence and to position myself for future expansion into Scandinavia.
- Moving the fleet from Edinburgh (EDI) to the North Sea (NTH) is crucial for establishing dominance in that area and potentially threatening Denmark (DEN) or Holland (HOL) in the future.
- The fleet in London (LON) will also move to the North Sea (NTH) to support the fleet from EDI and to maintain pressure on Germany while keeping options open for future moves towards France or Denmark.
- The army in Liverpool (LVP) will hold to ensure that my home centers remain secure while I focus on naval dominance.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

MESSAGES THIS ROUND
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 AUSTRIA: To all powers, I am looking to establish a strong position in the Balkans and would like to discuss potential cooperation. I believe that mutual interests can lead to a more stable region for all of us.
 ITALY: As Italy, I am focused on securing the Adriatic Sea and expanding my influence in the region. I welcome any discussions with other powers interested in forming alliances or sharing insights on our strategies.
 RUSSIA: To all powers: As Russia, I am focused on securing Rumania and countering any potential threats from Turkey and Austria. I am open to discussions about how we can maintain stability in the region and ensure our mutual interests are protected.
 TURKEY: To all powers: Turkey is looking to solidify its position in the Balkans and is open to discussions regarding potential alliances or cooperation. I believe that a united front can lead to mutual benefits for all involved.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Hello Russia, I appreciate your proposal to work together against Turkey. I believe securing Rumania is crucial for both of us. I am willing to support your move into Rumania if you can assist me in securing Bulgaria. Let's coordinate our efforts to strengthen our positions in the Balkans.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Hi Russia, I appreciate your proposal for a non-aggression pact. Given our current positions, it seems wise to avoid conflict while we both focus on our respective fronts. I am open to this agreement, but I would like to keep communication open to ensure we can address any future developments.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Greetings Russia, I appreciate your outreach. I agree that maintaining open lines of communication is crucial. While I am focused on the west, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to avoid conflict in the early stages. Let's keep our borders secure and perhaps explore opportunities for cooperation in the future.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  RUSSIA: Hello Turkey, I appreciate your interest in coordinating efforts in the Balkans. However, I must express my concern about your intentions towards Bulgaria. I believe it would be more beneficial for both of us to focus on countering Austria's influence together. Perhaps we can agree to support each other in our respective territories while keeping an eye on Austria's movements?
  TURKEY: Hi Russia, I appreciate your focus on securing your borders. I assure you that I have no intentions of interfering with your plans in Rumania and Bulgaria. In fact, I believe we can work together to apply pressure on Austria. Let's coordinate our efforts to ensure we both benefit from our expansion in the Balkans.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  RUSSIA: Hi Italy, I see you are looking to establish a foothold in the Mediterranean. While my focus is primarily on the Balkans and the North, I believe we could find common ground. If you can keep Austria occupied in the Adriatic, I can assist by applying pressure from the north. Let's discuss how we can mutually benefit from our positions.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Turkey is seeking to establish a foothold in the Balkans and has communicated with Russia about coordinating efforts against Austria. Russia has expressed a desire for a peaceful relationship and requested assurance regarding Turkey's plans in the region. Austria has not responded to Turkey's proposal for a non-aggression pact, indicating potential hostility. Italy is looking for cooperation in the Mediterranean but has not engaged directly with Turkey. England remains neutral and open to alliances.

[S1901M] Turkey has issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea, the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and the army in Smyrna to hold position. The strategic intent is to secure Bulgaria for expansion and strengthen ties with Russia while preparing for potential aggression against Austria.

[F1901M] Turkey has established a cooperative dialogue with Russia, agreeing to support each other's interests against Austria. Austria remains cautious and unfriendly, while Italy expresses interest in mutual benefits but is focused on Austria. England and Germany are neutral but open to discussions. No significant commitments have been made by any power, and Austria's intentions are still a concern.

MESSAGES THIS ROUND
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 AUSTRIA: To all powers, I am looking to establish a strong position in the Balkans and would like to discuss potential cooperation. I believe that mutual interests can lead to a more stable region for all of us.
 ITALY: As Italy, I am focused on securing the Adriatic Sea and expanding my influence in the region. I welcome any discussions with other powers interested in forming alliances or sharing insights on our strategies.
 RUSSIA: To all powers: As Russia, I am focused on securing Rumania and countering any potential threats from Turkey and Austria. I am open to discussions about how we can maintain stability in the region and ensure our mutual interests are protected.
 TURKEY: To all powers: Turkey is looking to solidify its position in the Balkans and is open to discussions regarding potential alliances or cooperation. I believe that a united front can lead to mutual benefits for all involved.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  AUSTRIA: Greetings Turkey, I appreciate your offer for a non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your intentions in the Balkans. While I am open to avoiding conflict for now, I believe we should keep communication open to ensure our interests do not clash. Let's agree to monitor each other's movements closely.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Hello Turkey, I see you are looking to establish a strong foothold in the Balkans. While my focus is on the North Sea and countering Germany, I believe there could be opportunities for us to cooperate. If you are interested, I would like to discuss how we can align our interests in the region.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Hello Turkey, I see you are looking to establish a foothold in the Balkans. While my focus is primarily on Northern Europe, I am open to discussing potential cooperation. If we can agree to respect each other's territories, it could lead to mutual benefits. Let's keep the lines of communication open.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ITALY: Hi Turkey! I see you are looking to establish a foothold in the Balkans. While I have my sights set on Austria, I believe we could find a way to mutually benefit from our positions. Let's explore potential cooperation.
  TURKEY: Hello Italy, I see you are looking to establish a strong foothold in the Mediterranean. While my focus is currently on the Balkans, I am open to discussing potential cooperation that could benefit us both. Perhaps we can find a way to support each other's interests in the region?

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  RUSSIA: Hello Turkey, I appreciate your interest in coordinating efforts in the Balkans. However, I must express my concern about your intentions towards Bulgaria. I believe it would be more beneficial for both of us to focus on countering Austria's influence together. Perhaps we can agree to support each other in our respective territories while keeping an eye on Austria's movements?
  TURKEY: Hi Russia, I appreciate your focus on securing your borders. I assure you that I have no intentions of interfering with your plans in Rumania and Bulgaria. In fact, I believe we can work together to apply pressure on Austria. Let's coordinate our efforts to ensure we both benefit from our expansion in the Balkans.

3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Bulgaria (BUL) and prepare for further expansion into Rumania (RUM) while maintaining a cooperative relationship with Russia.
- The army in Bulgaria (A BUL) will hold position to consolidate control over the supply center.
- The fleet in the Black Sea (F BLA) will support the army in Bulgaria, ensuring that I can defend against any potential threats from Austria or coordinate with Russia for future moves into Rumania.
- The army in Smyrna (A SMY) will hold position to maintain control over my home centers and be ready to support future moves if needed.
