intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

EXAMPLES:

Scenario 1: As France, after discussing a joint move against Germany with England, while Italy seems to be posturing aggressively in Piedmont.

intercepting-france,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea regions to secure additional supply centers. Currently, Turkey controls Smyrna, Constantinople, and Ankara, with potential to push into Bulgaria, Rumania, and the Black Sea.

- The immediate opportunity is to move into Bulgaria (BUL) and Rumania (RUM) to gain new centers. Bulgaria is only one move away from Ankara, and Rumania is accessible via support from the Black Sea fleet.
- Supporting the move into Bulgaria with Ankara's army will secure a critical expansion point.
- Moving the fleet from ANK to the Black Sea (BLA) will threaten Rumania and support future expansion.
- Holding Smyrna for now is strategic; it can serve as a staging ground for future pushes or defense.
- Since Russia is friendly, I will avoid conflict with them and focus on expansion into Bulgaria and Rumania, which are key to reaching 18 centers.

**Orders:**

- F ANK S F SEV - ARM (supporting the move into Rumania)
- A CON - BUL (advance into Bulgaria)
- A SMY - CON (move to support Bulgaria or prepare for future expansion)
- F BLA - RUM (aiming to take Rumania)
- Hold units that are not immediately needed for expansion to maintain flexibility

This aggressive stance aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumania quickly, setting the stage for further expansion into the Balkans and Black Sea.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is GERMANY. The S1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.

Power: GERMANY
Phase: S1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure the Western Front by establishing a strong position in Belgium and the Low Countries, potentially supporting an early move into the English Channel or North Sea to threaten England.
- Form a strategic alliance with Austria to contain Russia and Italy, while preparing for a potential eastern or southern expansion depending on diplomatic developments.
- Maintain a flexible stance with France and England, avoiding early conflicts while gathering intelligence and positioning for future offensives.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Unfriendly
- ENGLAND: Unfriendly
- FRANCE: Neutral
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Enemy
- TURKEY: Enemy

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany has maintained a neutral stance with France and Italy, while focusing on consolidating positions in the north and east. No new agreements have been reached, and Austria and England remain unfriendly, with Russia and Turkey as enemies. The silence from some powers suggests a cautious or hostile posture. Germany continues to prepare for expansion in the Low Countries and potentially into the North Sea or English Channel, while keeping options open for eastern and southern moves.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control only 3 centers. The immediate focus should be on consolidating my position in the north and pushing into unclaimed centers nearby.

- I will move my fleet from Kiel to Denmark to threaten the neutral center and potentially secure it in the next turn.
- My army in Berlin will hold to defend against any French or Russian threats, but I will prepare to support a move into Prussia if the opportunity arises.
- My army in Munich will move to support the attack into Prussia or hold depending on the situation.
- I will also consider supporting the move from Kiel into Holland to secure that center, as it is only two moves away and crucial for expansion.
- Since I want to threaten the English Channel and North Sea, I will keep my fleet in Kie ready to support or move into the North Sea if the opportunity presents itself.

This aggressive stance aims to threaten England and France early, while also positioning for expansion into the Low Countries and Scandinavia.

**Orders:**

- F KIE - DEN (to threaten Denmark and prepare for future expansion)
- A BER - PRU (to threaten or support the move into Prussia)
- A MUN - SIL (to threaten or support the move into Prussia or hold for defense)
- F HOL - NTH (to threaten the North Sea and support future moves)
- A BER S A MUN - PRU (supporting the move into Prussia to secure the region)

**Note:** I will hold the army in Berlin for now, but support from Munich or Kiel can be arranged if needed.

*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure key supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls four centers: MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. To achieve world domination, we need to seize additional centers, especially in Eastern Europe and the Balkans, while maintaining a strong position in the north and east.

Given the current map and relationships, I see an opportunity to push into the Balkans and secure RUM, ANK, and BUL, which are relatively accessible and vital for further expansion into the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Our units are well-positioned to support these moves.

- Moving A WAR to LVN will threaten the German border and potentially cut off their access to the Baltic.
- Moving A MOS to UKR will threaten Ukraine and open a route southward.
- Moving A WAR to UKR is a strong move to threaten the southern flank and prepare for future expansion into RUM and BLA.
- F SEV can support the move to RUM, aiming to take control of that center.
- Supporting A WAR S A UKR will reinforce our eastern front and prepare for further expansion into RUM and BLA.
- Moving A SEV to BLA will threaten Turkey's holdings and open a new front in the Balkans.
- Moving F SEV to ARM will threaten Turkey's holdings and open a route into the Middle East.

This plan aims to secure RUM, BLA, and ARM, which are critical for expanding into the Balkans and the Middle East, and to threaten Germany and Turkey simultaneously. It also keeps options open for future support and support moves.

**Orders:**

- A WAR - LVN
- A MOS - UKR
- A WAR - UKR
- F SEV - RUM
- F SEV S A BUD - RUM
- A SEV - BLA
- F SEV - ARM

This aggressive stance should help us gain more centers and position for further expansion.

Power: ENGLAND
Phase: S1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure and expand in Western Europe by establishing control over key supply centers such as Belgium, Holland, and the North Sea, while maintaining a strong naval presence to threaten France and Germany.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to contain Germany and Italy, focusing on a balanced approach that discourages early aggression from either neighbor.
- Prepare for a potential conflict with Turkey and Russia by positioning fleets and armies to threaten their supply centers, while keeping diplomatic options open for future alliances or betrayals.
Relationships: - FRANCE: Unfriendly
- GERMANY: Unfriendly
- ITALY: Neutral
- RUSSIA: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] England has maintained communication with all powers, but France, Germany, Russia, and Turkey remain unfriendly or hostile, with no recent responses to messages. Italy remains neutral. The current game state shows England with fleets in Edinburgh, London, and the North Sea, aiming to secure and expand in Western Europe while preparing for potential conflicts. Relationships are strained, especially with France and Germany, indicating a need to reassess diplomatic strategies and consider more assertive or strategic moves.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate goal is to expand and secure key supply centers in Western Europe, particularly Belgium, Holland, and the North Sea, to build a strong foundation for later dominance. Given the current map and the unfriendly relationships with France, Germany, Russia, and Turkey, we need to be assertive but also cautious about overextending.

- The fleets in Edinburgh, London, and the North Sea give us options to threaten France and Germany, and to support expansion into Belgium, Holland, and the North Sea.
- The nearest uncontrolled centers are Belgium, Holland, and the Low Countries, all within reach if we push aggressively.
- Moving F EDI to NTH or YOR can threaten German and French centers, while supporting moves into Belgium or Holland.
- The fleet in London can support EDI or move to the North Sea to threaten Germany or France.
- The army in LVP is well-positioned to support or move into Belgium or Holland if the opportunity arises.
- Holding in LON and EDI for now, but prepared to support or attack as needed.

Given the unfriendly stance, I will focus on aggressive expansion, aiming to threaten or take Belgium and Holland, while maintaining naval pressure on France and Germany.

**Orders:**

- F EDI - NTH (to threaten or support into Belgium)
- F LON - NTH (to support EDI or threaten Germany)
- A LVP - BEL (to secure Belgium)
- F NORTH SEA - HOL (to threaten or support into Holland)
- Hold in London and Edinburgh to keep options open and support as needed.

**Final Orders:**

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Italy controls NAP, ROM, and VEN, with potential to expand into Greece, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean.

- NAP is a strong starting point for expansion into the Ionian and Aegean, with Greece (GRE) and TUN nearby as key targets.
- ROM and VEN are well-positioned to support moves into the Balkans and to threaten Austria and France.
- France remains friendly, so we can coordinate to avoid conflict there, but we should be prepared to shift if opportunities arise.
- Austria is unfriendly, so we should consider attacking TRI and BUD to weaken their hold on the eastern front.
- The immediate move should focus on pushing into Greece (ION) and possibly TUN, while consolidating control over our core centers.

Given the current possible moves, I will:
- Use F NAP to support a move into ION or TUN.
- Use A VEN to attack TRI, supported by A APU.
- Keep A ROM and A VEN flexible for future expansion.
- Use F NAP to support the move into TUN if possible, or hold to defend.

This aggressive stance aims to open new fronts and secure more centers quickly, setting up for further expansion in subsequent turns.

**Orders:**
- F NAP S A VEN - ION (supporting an attack on Greece)
- A VEN - TRI (attack Austria's Trieste)
- A APU S A VEN - TRI (supporting Venice's attack on Trieste)
- A ROM H (hold for now, to defend and prepare for future moves)
- F NAP - TYS (move fleet to Tyrrhenian to threaten or support future operations)

**Note:** The move into TUN is not possible this turn, but positioning F NAP in TYS prepares for future expansion into the Mediterranean.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.

*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Italy to secure additional supply centers. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with potential to take RUM and SER, which are only one move away. The immediate strategic priority is to push into RUM and SER to increase our centers, while maintaining a defensive stance against Germany and France.

- BUD is well-positioned to support a move into RUM or SER, and I will order A BUD to support A WAR into SER, aiming to take control of Serbia.
- A VIE can support A BUD into SER, reinforcing the attack.
- A VIE should also prepare to move into TRI or VIE itself, depending on the situation, but for now, I will hold to see how the situation develops.
- TRI's fleet can move to support an attack on VEN or hold, but since Italy is neutral, I will focus on expansion in the Balkans first.
- F TRI will hold to defend against Italian or other threats.
- I will also consider a move from TRI to ADR to threaten Italy or support an attack on VEN if the opportunity arises.

The overall plan is to push into RUM and SER, secure the Balkans, and prepare for further expansion into Italy and the East.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A WAR - GAL (supporting WAR into GAL to threaten or dislodge RUS)
- A VIE S A BUD - SER (support BUD into SER)
- A VIE - TRI (to threaten or support future moves)
- F TRI H (hold for now, to defend against Italian or French threats)
- A WAR - GAL (to support BUD's move into SER and threaten RUS)

This aggressive stance aims to secure RUM and SER early, which are critical for reaching 18 centers.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
What a white-knuckle opener! England roars out of port to seize the North Sea, and Germany follows with a shock-and-awe eastern blitz—planting the flag in Denmark while armies tear into Prussia and Silesia. Down south the sky darkens as a gleaming Russo-Turkish Juggernaut forms: Ankara escorts the Sevastopol fleet into Armenia and Turkish troops stride into Bulgaria and Constantinople. Austria’s misfired support and a bruising bounce with Italy at Trieste leave the Habsburgs wobbling, and the whole board crackles with anticipation for an explosive autumn.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
What a white-knuckle opener! England roars out of port to seize the North Sea, and Germany follows with a shock-and-awe eastern blitz—planting the flag in Denmark while armies tear into Prussia and Silesia. Down south the sky darkens as a gleaming Russo-Turkish Juggernaut forms: Ankara escorts the Sevastopol fleet into Armenia and Turkish troops stride into Bulgaria and Constantinople. Austria’s misfired support and a bruising bounce with Italy at Trieste leave the Habsburgs wobbling, and the whole board crackles with anticipation for an explosive autumn.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in the Balkans and Italy to gain early supply centers.
- Establish a defensive stance against Germany and France while exploring opportunities for alliances.
- Manage the Turkish border carefully, possibly delaying aggressive moves until a clearer strategic picture emerges.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
What a white-knuckle opener! England roars out of port to seize the North Sea, and Germany follows with a shock-and-awe eastern blitz—planting the flag in Denmark while armies tear into Prussia and Silesia. Down south the sky darkens as a gleaming Russo-Turkish Juggernaut forms: Ankara escorts the Sevastopol fleet into Armenia and Turkish troops stride into Bulgaria and Constantinople. Austria’s misfired support and a bruising bounce with Italy at Trieste leave the Habsburgs wobbling, and the whole board crackles with anticipation for an explosive autumn.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand in Italy's core regions (Naples, Rome, Venice) to establish a strong economic base for future expansion.
- Form a strategic alliance with France to contain German and Austrian threats, while preparing to leverage Italy's position for expansion into the Balkans and the Mediterranean.
- Assess and manage relationships with Turkey and Austria, avoiding early conflicts while positioning to exploit their weaknesses or opportunities for expansion.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

- Prepare to expand into the Balkans and Mediterranean once threats are contained.
- Assess and counter Turkish advances into Bulgaria and Armenia.
- Monitor German naval movements and defend against potential North Sea threats.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Italy maintains a friendly relationship with France, which is crucial for containing German and Austrian threats. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn. Austria remains unfriendly, and Russia and Turkey are unresponsive or neutral, indicating potential for future opportunistic moves. England is neutral, and Germany is an enemy, with no recent engagement.

[S1901M] I ordered A VEN to TRI to secure the northern flank, A ROM to hold to maintain stability in Italy, and F NAP to TYS to strengthen the southern position and prepare for future expansion in the Mediterranean.

[F1901M] Italy maintains a friendly stance with France, focusing on strengthening this alliance to counter German and Austrian threats. No new agreements have been made this turn, but communication remains open. Austria remains unfriendly, and Turkey, Russia, and Germany are all unfriendly or enemies, with limited engagement from these powers. Italy's units are positioned defensively in Rome, Venice, and Naples, with the fleet in TYS ready for Mediterranean operations.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Italy controls NAP, ROM, and VEN, totaling 3 centers. To achieve world domination, we need to seize opportunities in the Balkans and Mediterranean.

- **Focus on the Balkans:** Austria is unfriendly and controls TRI, BUD, and VIE. Our units in ROM and VEN are well-positioned to threaten TRI and BUD. Moving A ROM to VEN supports an attack on TRI, which is a key target. A VEN can also support this move or threaten BUD.

- **Secure the Mediterranean:** F TYS is poised to support moves into Tunis or defend against Turkish expansion. Moving F TYS to NAP or TUS can help us expand into North Africa or secure the southern flank.

- **Defend Italy:** Hold in Rome and Venice to maintain stability while expanding.

- **Support and Support Moves:** Use F TYS to support A ROM to TRI, and A VEN to support A ROM or move to TRI directly.

- **Potential for Future Expansion:** If we take TRI and BUD, we will be close to 6 centers. We should aim to push into Greece (GRE) and further into the Balkans next turn.

**Order plan:**

- A ROM to VEN (supporting an attack on TRI)
- A VEN to TRI (attack Austria's key center)
- F TYS to NAP (to threaten Tunisia or support Mediterranean expansion)
- Hold in Rome and Venice for now

This aggressive stance will help us gain key centers and push toward our 18-center goal.

gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] England has maintained communication with all powers, but France, Germany, Russia, and Turkey remain unfriendly or hostile, with no recent responses to messages. Italy remains neutral. The current game state shows England with fleets in Edinburgh, London, and the North Sea, aiming to secure and expand in Western Europe while preparing for potential conflicts. Relationships are strained, especially with France and Germany, indicating a need to reassess diplomatic strategies and consider more assertive or strategic moves.

[S1901M] England orders Fleet EDI and Fleet LON to move North, aiming to secure the North Sea and threaten France and Germany. Army LVP holds position, maintaining flexibility for future strategic decisions.

[F1901M] No messages involving England this round; diplomatic activity appears limited. Relationships remain tense with Germany, Russia, Turkey, and Austria, with France still unfriendly. The game state indicates a focus on naval dominance and countering German and Russian expansion. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, England controls London, Edinburgh, and Liverpool, with potential to expand into Belgium, Holland, and Scandinavia. The game state shows no immediate threats from France or Germany in the North Sea or the English Channel, and I have fleets positioned to threaten or support these expansions.

Given the current positions, I will focus on:

- Moving Fleet EDI to YOR to threaten the Norwegian coast and potentially support an attack on Scandinavia or Holland.
- Moving Fleet NTH to HOL to threaten the Dutch centers and prepare for future expansion into Belgium or Holland.
- Moving Army LVP to YOR to support fleet movements and prepare for a potential attack into Scandinavia or to secure the North Sea.
- Holding LVP for now, as I want to keep flexibility and avoid overextending.

This setup aims to threaten Germany and Scandinavia, pressure the Dutch centers, and open pathways for expansion into Belgium and Scandinavia in subsequent turns. It also keeps options open for future alliances or aggressive moves.

**Orders:**

- Fleet EDI S F NTH - YOR (supporting movement to threaten Scandinavia)
- Fleet NTH - HOL (aiming to threaten or take Holland)
- Army LVP - YOR (supporting fleet movement and preparing for expansion)
- Fleet LON H (hold for now, maintaining flexibility)

[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, focusing on securing the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean. No new agreements with England or France, as they remain neutral and unresponsive. Austria and Italy are perceived as enemies, with ongoing tensions. Germany continues to be an adversary, and their aggressive stance remains a concern.

[S1901M] I ordered F SEV to support ARM to strengthen Black Sea control, A CON to move towards BUL to secure the Balkans, and A SMY to move into CON to consolidate eastern Mediterranean holdings. The strategy aims to expand Turkey’s influence in the Black Sea and Balkan regions while maintaining flexibility for future alliances.

[F1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, securing their support for eastern expansion. No new agreements with Austria or Italy; their hostility persists. England and France remain neutral and unresponsive, indicating a cautious stance. Germany is identified as an enemy, with potential threats from their eastern moves. No messages from Austria and Italy suggest a need for more direct engagement or strategic pressure.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Turkey controls Ank (Ankara), Con (Constantinople), and Smy (Smyrna). We need to push into Bulgaria and potentially threaten Austria and Italy, while maintaining our eastern flank with Russia.

- Bulgaria (BUL) is a key target for expansion, as it is adjacent to both Ankara and Constantinople, and controlling it will give us a crucial supply center.
- Moving A BUL from Ankara supports our expansion into Bulgaria and consolidates our position in the Balkans.
- Supporting A BUL from Constantinople (A CON S A BUL) will help secure Bulgaria and prevent Austria from contesting it.
- Moving F ANK to BLA (Black Sea) will threaten Russia’s Black Sea holdings and keep Russia engaged on our eastern flank.
- Holding Ankara (F ANK H) maintains our position and prepares for future moves.
- Moving F ARM to BLA supports our Black Sea strategy and pressures Russia.
- Moving A BUL to RUM (Rumania) is a strategic move to threaten Austria and open a route into the Balkans, possibly supporting future expansion or defense.

This plan aims to secure Bulgaria, threaten Russia, and prepare for further expansion into the Balkans and Eastern Europe, aligning with our aggressive, expansionist strategy.

gpt-4.1-nano,GERMANY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Germany has maintained a neutral stance with France and Italy, while focusing on consolidating positions in the north and east. No new agreements have been reached, and Austria and England remain unfriendly, with Russia and Turkey as enemies. The silence from some powers suggests a cautious or hostile posture. Germany continues to prepare for expansion in the Low Countries and potentially into the North Sea or English Channel, while keeping options open for eastern and southern moves.

[S1901M] Germany orders F KIE to DEN, A BER to PRU, and A MUN to SIL. The strategy aims to strengthen the Western Front, secure the Low Countries, and prepare for potential expansion into Scandinavia or the North Sea, while maintaining a cautious stance towards France and England and positioning for future alliances and offensives.

[F1901M] Germany has maintained a neutral stance with France and Italy, while focusing on consolidating the north and east against Russia and Turkey. No new agreements have been reached this turn, but communication remains open. Austria and England remain unfriendly, with limited engagement. Russia and Turkey are considered enemies, with no recent responses from them. The focus remains on securing Denmark and Prussia, and preparing for potential conflicts in the east and west.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure key supply centers to reach 18. Currently, I control Berlin, Kiel, and Munich. I need to push into Scandinavia, the Low Countries, and Eastern Europe to gain more centers.

- Denmark (DEN) is a crucial target for expansion in the north, especially since it is adjacent to the North Sea and can serve as a springboard into Scandinavia.
- The Low Countries (BEL) are also vital, as they are close to France and England, and controlling them will help secure my western flank.
- I will move my fleet from Denmark into the Baltic (BAL) to threaten Sweden and support future moves into Scandinavia.
- My army in Prussia (PRU) will move to Silesia (SIL) to threaten Vienna and support eastern expansion.
- My army in Munich (MUN) will hold for now, but I am prepared to support moves into Austria or Poland if opportunities arise.
- I will support the move from DEN to SKA (Scandinavia) to threaten Sweden and prepare for future expansion.
- I will hold Kiel (KIE) to defend against potential French or English naval threats.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Denmark and push into Scandinavia, while supporting eastern expansion into Ukraine and the Baltic states. I will also keep communication open with Austria and Italy to exploit their weaknesses if possible.

- F DEN - BAL (to threaten Sweden and support Scandinavian expansion)
- A PRU - SIL (to threaten Vienna and support eastern expansion)
- A MUN - SIL (to support PRU's move and threaten Austria)
- F KIE - HOL (to threaten the Low Countries and prepare for future expansion)
- Support move: F DEN S F NTH - HEL (to support the move into the North Sea and threaten England)

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

[S1901M] Maintained a friendly stance with Germany, reinforcing the alliance and coordinating future moves. Austria remains unfriendly, with limited communication; Italy and France are unfriendly, with no recent responses. England and Turkey are not actively engaging, with England neutral and Turkey unfriendly. No new agreements or commitments have been established this turn.

[S1901M] Russia orders Army WAR to move to LVN, Army MOS to UKR, Army WAR to UKR, Fleet SEV to RUM, Fleet SEV supports Fleet BUD to RUM, Fleet SEV to ARM, and Fleet STP/SC hold. The strategy focuses on consolidating Eastern European and Balkan positions, strengthening alliances with Germany, and preparing for potential conflicts with Turkey, Austria, and Italy.

[F1901M] Maintained a strong alliance with Turkey, coordinating moves in the east and Balkan regions. No new agreements with Austria, England, France, or Germany; their hostility persists. Russia's messages remain unresponsive, indicating possible hostility or strategic silence. Focused on consolidating eastern positions and preparing for potential German advances.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls 4 centers (MOS, SEV, STP, WAR). We need to seize nearby centers, especially in the Balkans and Eastern Europe, while maintaining a strong eastern front.

In the east, our immediate focus is on the Turkish-controlled ANK and BUL, which are within reach. Moving ARM to ANK or BLA could threaten Turkey and open pathways for expansion into the Balkans. Supporting the move to ANK could be advantageous to threaten Turkey directly, but since Turkey is an ally, I prefer to keep the army in ARM supporting SEV to strengthen our eastern position and prepare for future moves.

In the north, moving F SEV to RUM will threaten Turkey's supply centers and potentially cut off their expansion. Moving F ARM to BLA supports our eastern flank and prepares for future expansion into the Balkans or Black Sea.

The army in WAR can support the move to LVN or hold to prepare for future offensives. Moving WAR to LVN or supporting A MOS to LVN could threaten Germany or open a route into the Baltic.

Given the current map and our strategic goals, I will:

- Support A WAR to LVN to threaten Germany and open a path into the Baltic.
- Move F SEV to RUM to threaten Turkey's centers.
- Support A MOS to LVN to reinforce our eastern expansion.
- Keep ARM supporting SEV to maintain eastern strength.

This plan aims to destabilize Turkey, threaten Germany, and position us for further expansion into the Balkans and Central Europe.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Austria's primary goal is to expand aggressively while maintaining a defensive posture against hostile neighbors. Currently, relationships with Italy, Turkey, Germany, France, and England are hostile, so I need to be cautious but also seize opportunities to gain supply centers, especially in the Balkans and Italy.

- BUD is a key position; I will support VIE to TRI to strengthen my hold in the region and prepare for future expansion.
- VIE should move to TRI to threaten Italy's position and potentially force Italy into a defensive stance or open opportunities for me to take Venice or other centers.
- TRI is currently held by my fleet; I will keep it holding to maintain control and threaten Italy's supply centers.
- I will also consider supporting A VEN from TRI to prepare for an attack on Venice, or move A VIE to TRI to reinforce the attack.
- Since Italy is unfriendly, I want to pressure Venice and possibly threaten Italy's supply centers to weaken their position.

Given the current map and relationships, I will focus on consolidating my Balkan holdings and pressuring Italy to open up opportunities for expansion into Venice and possibly further into Italy.

**Orders:**

- A BUD S A VIE - TRI (support VIE to TRI)
- A VIE - TRI (move to TRI to threaten Italy)
- F TRI - ADR (to threaten Italy's southern flank and support future moves)
- A VEN - TRI (attack Venice, supported by TRI)
- F TYS - ION (to threaten Italy's fleet in TYS and support future operations)

This setup aims to pressure Italy, secure my Balkan positions, and prepare for further expansion.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
England ignites the show, surging out of the North Sea to seize Holland and steal Germany’s breath—and a center—in one audacious strike. In the east, Turkey’s Bulgarian dash into Rumania plants the crescent moon firmly on the Danube while Russia creeps from Moscow to Livonia, scenting German weakness. Austria pulls off a crowd-pleasing pirouette: Vienna, backed by Budapest, retakes Trieste and leaves Italy’s would-be invaders and Germany’s bungled “support” flailing in empty air. With three powers now on four centers and alliances already splintering, Winter 1901 is poised to detonate!

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
England ignites the show, surging out of the North Sea to seize Holland and steal Germany’s breath—and a center—in one audacious strike. In the east, Turkey’s Bulgarian dash into Rumania plants the crescent moon firmly on the Danube while Russia creeps from Moscow to Livonia, scenting German weakness. Austria pulls off a crowd-pleasing pirouette: Vienna, backed by Budapest, retakes Trieste and leaves Italy’s would-be invaders and Germany’s bungled “support” flailing in empty air. With three powers now on four centers and alliances already splintering, Winter 1901 is poised to detonate!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure and expand naval control in the North Sea and adjacent waters to threaten Germany and France.
- Prepare to counter German eastward expansion by positioning fleets and armies for a potential invasion of Denmark or the North Sea.
- Strengthen diplomatic efforts to isolate Austria and Turkey, possibly forming a coalition against their eastern and southern threats.
- Coordinate with France to contain German aggression and explore potential alliance options.
- Monitor Russian and Turkish movements closely, and consider preemptive actions to prevent encirclement.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
England ignites the show, surging out of the North Sea to seize Holland and steal Germany’s breath—and a center—in one audacious strike. In the east, Turkey’s Bulgarian dash into Rumania plants the crescent moon firmly on the Danube while Russia creeps from Moscow to Livonia, scenting German weakness. Austria pulls off a crowd-pleasing pirouette: Vienna, backed by Budapest, retakes Trieste and leaves Italy’s would-be invaders and Germany’s bungled “support” flailing in empty air. With three powers now on four centers and alliances already splintering, Winter 1901 is poised to detonate!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Solidify alliance with Russia to secure the Black Sea and eastern flank.
- Expand control over Bulgaria and Armenia to strengthen eastern position.
- Seek diplomatic negotiations with Austria and Italy to prevent early conflicts and explore potential cooperation.
- Maintain cautious neutrality with England and France, avoiding unnecessary conflicts while monitoring their actions.
- Prepare for potential threats from Germany and consider strategic moves to counter their eastern expansion.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, focusing on securing the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean. No new agreements with England or France, as they remain neutral and unresponsive. Austria and Italy are perceived as enemies, with ongoing tensions. Germany continues to be an adversary, and their aggressive stance remains a concern.

[S1901M] I ordered F SEV to support ARM to strengthen Black Sea control, A CON to move towards BUL to secure the Balkans, and A SMY to move into CON to consolidate eastern Mediterranean holdings. The strategy aims to expand Turkey’s influence in the Black Sea and Balkan regions while maintaining flexibility for future alliances.

[F1901M] Maintained friendly relations with Russia, securing their support for eastern expansion. No new agreements with Austria or Italy; their hostility persists. England and France remain neutral and unresponsive, indicating a cautious stance. Germany is identified as an enemy, with potential threats from their eastern moves. No messages from Austria and Italy suggest a need for more direct engagement or strategic pressure.

[F1901M] I ordered F ANK to BLA to secure the Black Sea, A CON to support A BUL to strengthen the eastern flank, F ANK to hold, and A BUL to RUM to expand into Bulgaria. These moves aim to solidify alliances, expand territory, and prepare for potential conflicts with Germany while maintaining diplomatic flexibility.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand Turkey’s influence in the Balkans and the Black Sea, while maintaining a flexible stance against Germany and Italy. Given the current positions and recent moves, I want to secure Bulgaria and Armenia, and prepare for potential German aggression in the North Sea and Denmark.

- I will support RUM to ROV to strengthen the eastern flank and secure a vital supply center.
- I will move ANK to BLA to threaten the Black Sea and potentially cut off Austria or Italy from the region.
- I will move CON to BUL to push into Bulgaria, aiming to take control of this key Balkan center.
- I will hold Smyrna to defend against any Italian or Greek threats, but keep it flexible for future moves.
- Fleet in ANK will support BLA to ensure Black Sea control, and Army in CON will support BUL to maximize expansion.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Bulgaria and Armenia early, while supporting Russia’s expansion and positioning for future conflicts with Germany and Italy.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] England has maintained communication with all powers, but France, Germany, Russia, and Turkey remain unfriendly or hostile, with no recent responses to messages. Italy remains neutral. The current game state shows England with fleets in Edinburgh, London, and the North Sea, aiming to secure and expand in Western Europe while preparing for potential conflicts. Relationships are strained, especially with France and Germany, indicating a need to reassess diplomatic strategies and consider more assertive or strategic moves.

[S1901M] England orders Fleet EDI and Fleet LON to move North, aiming to secure the North Sea and threaten France and Germany. Army LVP holds position, maintaining flexibility for future strategic decisions.

[F1901M] No messages involving England this round; diplomatic activity appears limited. Relationships remain tense with Germany, Russia, Turkey, and Austria, with France still unfriendly. The game state indicates a focus on naval dominance and countering German and Russian expansion. No new agreements or commitments have been made this turn.

[F1901M] I ordered F EDI to support F NTH moving to YOR, F NTH to move to HOL, and A LVP to support YOR. The strategy focuses on securing the North Sea and adjacent waters, preparing for German eastward expansion, and maintaining naval dominance to threaten Germany and France.

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to expand and secure supply centers aggressively, aiming for world domination. Currently, I control three centers (LON, EDI, LVP), and I need to push into additional centers to reach 18.

Given the current map and relationships, I see opportunities to threaten France and Germany, especially in the West, while maintaining naval dominance in the North Sea and surrounding waters. France is unfriendly, so I should consider pressuring them, possibly by supporting moves into their centers or threatening their coastlines. Germany is an enemy, so I should prepare to attack or threaten their centers, especially KIE and BER.

I will focus on the following strategic moves:

- Use Fleet LON to support Fleet EDI to move North into the North Sea, threatening German and French interests.
- Fleet EDI will move to the North Sea to threaten Germany and France.
- Fleet HOL will move to the English Channel to threaten France and support future operations.
- Army YOR will hold for now, maintaining flexibility.
- Consider supporting Fleet NTH to move to YOR to threaten the French coast and support expansion.
- Prepare to support or attack German centers in KIE and BER in subsequent turns.

This aggressive stance will help me secure key naval positions, threaten France and Germany, and set up future expansion into their centers.

**Orders:**

- Fleet EDI to support F NTH - YOR (to threaten the French coast and support expansion)
- Fleet NTH to move to YOR (to threaten France and support expansion)
- Fleet HOL to move to ENG (to control the Channel and threaten France)
- Army YOR to hold (flexibility for future moves)
- Support move for Fleet EDI to North Sea if needed in future turns

**Note:** Since only the current possible orders are available, I will choose the most aggressive and strategic moves based on the current options.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
A chill Winter 1901 can’t freeze the action: England roars into 1902 by planting a brand-new army in London, signalling either a sledgehammer swing at Germany or a surprise cross-Channel raid on France. Turkey counters with a gleaming fleet in Smyrna, a bold hint that the Sultan’s eyes are on the Aegean and Italy’s soft underbelly—Austria can already feel the water rising in the Adriatic. With England, Russia, and Turkey now dead-even on four centers while the rest sit uneasily at three, the table is set for the first great betrayal of the game. Buckle up, spectators—the opening courtesies are over, and the knives are coming out for Spring 1902!

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
A chill Winter 1901 can’t freeze the action: England roars into 1902 by planting a brand-new army in London, signalling either a sledgehammer swing at Germany or a surprise cross-Channel raid on France. Turkey counters with a gleaming fleet in Smyrna, a bold hint that the Sultan’s eyes are on the Aegean and Italy’s soft underbelly—Austria can already feel the water rising in the Adriatic. With England, Russia, and Turkey now dead-even on four centers while the rest sit uneasily at three, the table is set for the first great betrayal of the game. Buckle up, spectators—the opening courtesies are over, and the knives are coming out for Spring 1902!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Defend Warsaw against German Silesia advance, possibly by supporting or repositioning units.
- Strengthen alliance with Turkey through coordinated moves and diplomatic communication.
- Seek opportunities to pressure Austria in the Balkans and Italy in the north to weaken their positions.
- Monitor English expansion into the North Sea and Holland, prepare to counter or negotiate.
- Exploit Austria's defensive posture to seize additional Balkan centers, such as Trieste or Budapest.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
A chill Winter 1901 can’t freeze the action: England roars into 1902 by planting a brand-new army in London, signalling either a sledgehammer swing at Germany or a surprise cross-Channel raid on France. Turkey counters with a gleaming fleet in Smyrna, a bold hint that the Sultan’s eyes are on the Aegean and Italy’s soft underbelly—Austria can already feel the water rising in the Adriatic. With England, Russia, and Turkey now dead-even on four centers while the rest sit uneasily at three, the table is set for the first great betrayal of the game. Buckle up, spectators—the opening courtesies are over, and the knives are coming out for Spring 1902!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Solidify alliance with Russia and coordinate to defend against German expansion.
- Secure control over Bulgaria and Armenia to strengthen eastern position.
- Engage diplomatically with Austria and Italy to prevent early conflicts and explore cooperation.
- Monitor German movements in the North Sea and Denmark, prepare defenses or countermeasures.
- Maintain cautious neutrality with England and France, avoiding unnecessary conflicts while observing their actions.

    ""Find anti-Russia ally""
  ]
}

4. As England, after a failed attack on Belgium (BEL) which was occupied by France, supported by Germany. Russia moved into Sweden (SWE) uncontested. Austria and Italy skirmished over Trieste (TRI). Turkey was quiet.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""My attack on Belgium was decisively repulsed due to Franco-German cooperation, marking them as a significant threat bloc. Russia's acquisition of Sweden is concerning for my northern position. The Austro-Italian conflict seems localized for now, and Turkey's inactivity makes them an unknown variable, potentially open to diplomacy."",
  ""relationships"": {
    ""FRANCE"": ""Enemy"",
    ""GERMANY"": ""Enemy"",
    ""RUSSIA"": ""Unfriendly"",
    ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",
    ""ITALY"": ""Neutral"",
    ""TURKEY"": ""Neutral""
  },
  ""goals"": [
    ""Break the Franco-German alliance or find a way to counter their combined strength."",
    ""Secure North Sea (NTH) and prevent further Russian expansion towards Norway (NWY)."",
    ""Seek dialogue with Turkey or Austria/Italy to create a counterweight to the dominant bloc.""
  ]
}

5. As Russia, after successfully negotiating passage through Black Sea (BLA) with Turkey to take Rumania (RUM). Germany moved into Silesia (SIL), threatening Warsaw (WAR). Austria and France exchanged hostile messages but made no direct moves against each other. England built a new fleet in London (LON). Italy seems focused west.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""Securing Rumania via Turkish agreement is a major success. This improves my southern position and Turkey is now a provisional ally. Germany's move into Silesia is a direct and immediate threat to Warsaw; they are now my primary adversary. Austria and France are posturing, but their conflict doesn't directly affect me yet, keeping them neutral. England's new fleet is a long-term concern but not immediate. Italy's westward focus means they are not a current threat or priority."",
  ""relationships"": {
    ""GERMANY"": ""Enemy"",
    ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",
    ""TURKEY"": ""Ally"",
    ""ITALY"": ""Neutral"",
    ""FRANCE"": ""Neutral"",

  },
  ""goals"": [
    ""Defend Warsaw against Germany, possibly by moving Lvn-War or Mos-War."",
    ""Solidify alliance with Turkey, potentially coordinating further moves in the south or against Austria if Germany allies with them."",
    ""Monitor English fleet movements and prepare for a potential northern threat in future turns."",
