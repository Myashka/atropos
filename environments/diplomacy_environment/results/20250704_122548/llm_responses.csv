gpt-4.1-nano,ENGLAND,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for ENGLAND in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

TASK
Analyze the negotiations, goals, relationships, and game state to:
1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements
2. State your strategic intent for S1901M
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

gpt-4.1-nano,RUSSIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure key supply centers to reach 18. Currently, Russia controls four centers: MOS, SEV, STP, WAR. We need to push into Ukraine (UKR) and Rumania (RUM) to gain more centers, and potentially threaten Austria and Turkey to weaken their positions.

Germany is friendly, so I will coordinate with them to secure the East and avoid conflict. Austria is unfriendly, so I should consider attacking BUD or VIE if possible, but for now, I will focus on consolidating and expanding eastward.

The immediate opportunity is to move A MOS into UKR, which is only two moves away, and supports expansion into RUM later. Also, A WAR can move to LVN to threaten the German border and open options for future expansion.

SEV is already holding and can support moves into RUM or BLA, but I will hold for now to see how the situation develops.

Orders:
- A MOS to UKR to start pushing into Ukraine.
- A WAR to LVN to threaten the German border and prepare for future expansion.
- F SEV to RUM to threaten Turkey and expand influence in the Black Sea.
- F STP/SC will hold to support the fleet in SEV and maintain control of the Baltic.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Ukraine and Rumania quickly, then pivot to threaten Austria and Turkey, aiming to reach 18 centers.

**Orders:**

- A MOS - UKR
- A WAR - LVN
- F SEV - RUM
- F STP/SC H

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Germany's primary goal is to expand aggressively while consolidating control of our core centers and pushing into new territories. Currently, our units are positioned well for a proactive approach:

- The fleet in KIE can move to HOL or DEN to threaten or secure those centers.
- The army in MUN is well-placed to push into Belgium or support an attack into France later.
- The army in BER can either hold or support moves into PRU or KIE, depending on the situation.
- The overall strategy is to secure the Low Countries (Holland and Belgium) quickly, as they are key to expanding into the West, and to threaten France and Russia to the East.

Given the current map and options, I will:

- Move F KIE to HOL to threaten or potentially take Holland.
- Move A MUN to KIE to threaten or support an attack into the Low Countries.
- Keep A BER on hold for now, but ready to support or move if needed.
- Prepare for a potential push into Belgium or France next turn.
- Support the move of A MUN to KIE with F KIE to maximize pressure.

This aggressive stance aims to secure early expansion in the West, which is critical for reaching 18 centers.

**Orders:**

- F KIE - HOL
- A MUN - KIE
- A BER H
- F KIE - HOL (supporting the move)
- A MUN S A BER - KIE (support move to reinforce)

**Note:** Since the orders must match the provided options, I will choose the most aggressive and supportive moves within the list.

gpt-4.1-nano,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand in the Balkans and Italy, leveraging our alliance with Germany to contain France and secure key centers. Currently, Austria controls BUD, TRI, and VIE, with potential to push further into RUM, SER, and BUL, which are nearby and accessible. Our units are positioned well for a proactive expansion.

- **A BUD**: I will support a move to TRI to threaten Italy's control of Venice and potentially force Italy into a defensive stance. Moving A BUD to TRI is aggressive but supports our overall expansion in Italy and the Balkans.
- **A VIE**: I will support a move to TRI to reinforce the attack and threaten Italy's Venice. Alternatively, I could hold, but supporting TRI increases pressure on Italy.
- **F TRI**: I will move to VEN to threaten Italy's supply centers and support the attack on Venice, aiming to weaken Italy's position.
- **A VIE S A BUD - GAL**: This support move helps secure Galicia, which is a strategic buffer and can be used to threaten RUM or support future pushes east.

gpt-4.1-nano,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our immediate goal is to expand Italy’s control over key centers in the Mediterranean and Italian Peninsula, setting the stage for future expansion into central and eastern Europe. Currently, Italy controls NAP, ROM, and VEN, with neighboring units from Austria, France, and Turkey posing threats.

- NAP is a strategic starting point; moving to TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea) supports future naval operations and defends against French or Austrian threats.
- ROM can either hold or support an attack on TRI (Trieste). Since Austria is unfriendly and controls TRI, I want to threaten TRI to pressure Austria and potentially force a move or support.
- VEN is well-positioned to support an attack on TRI or defend against Austria’s units.
- The fleet in NAP can move to TYS to threaten Austria’s TRI or support an attack on TRI from the sea.
- The units in APU and VEN can coordinate to attack TRI, supported by the fleet in ION if needed.

Given the current map and the goal of aggressive expansion, I will:
- Support an attack on TRI from VEN and APU.
- Use NAP to move to TYS, supporting the attack or defending.
- Keep ROM on hold for now, as it’s a key position and can support or defend as needed.

This move aims to threaten Austria’s TRI, potentially forcing Austria to divert units or support, and to gain a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean.

**Orders:**
- A VEN S F TRI - TRI (support attack on TRI from Venice)
- A APU S A VEN - TRI (support attack on TRI from Apulia)
- F NAP - TYS (naval move to Tyrrhenian Sea to support or threaten Austria)
- A ROM H (hold to maintain position and flexibility)

     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively and secure additional supply centers to reach 18. Currently, we control only 3 centers, so we need to seize nearby unclaimed centers quickly. The most accessible targets are Belgium (BEL), Holland (HOL), and Denmark (DEN), which are all within reach from our current positions.

- **Belgium (BEL):** It’s only two moves away from London or the English Channel. Securing Belgium will give us a valuable supply center and a foothold in Western Europe.
- **Holland (HOL):** Also nearby, and controlling it will further solidify our Western European position.
- **Denmark (DEN):** Slightly further but still within reach, especially if we coordinate with our fleet in the North Sea.

Given the current map, I will:
- Use the fleet in the North Sea (F KIE) to move into Denmark, aiming to take it next turn.
- Move the fleet in the English Channel (F BRE) to support a move into Belgium.
- Use the fleet in the English Channel (F BRE) to support the move into Belgium from the coast.
- Move the fleet in the North Sea (F NTH) to support the move into Holland.
- Use the fleet in the North Sea (F NTH) to support the move into Holland from the coast.

This aggressive stance aims to quickly expand into these centers, with support to ensure success. I will hold the units in London and Edinburgh for now, focusing on expansion.

**Support and attack plan:**
- F EDI supports F LON to YOR (not an immediate target but useful for flexibility).
- F LON moves to YOR to threaten the Yorkshire area, possibly supporting future expansion.
- F BRE moves to BEL with support from F NTH.
- F NTH moves to HOL with support from F KIE.
- F KIE moves into DEN, supported by F NTH.

This plan prioritizes rapid expansion in the West and North, setting the stage for further aggressive moves next turn.

gpt-4.1-nano,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] Maintained a neutral stance with England and France, while establishing a friendly relationship with Italy. No significant agreements reached this turn, but the focus remains on consolidating control over Anatolia and the Balkans, and preparing for potential conflicts with Austria and Russia. Austria remains unfriendly, and Germany is unfriendly, indicating a need for caution and strategic positioning.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

Our primary goal is to expand aggressively in the Balkans and Anatolia, securing key supply centers like Bulgaria, Rumelia, and Greece, while maintaining a strong position in the Black Sea and the Turkish coast. Italy is our ally, and we should leverage this relationship to contain Austria and push into the Balkans. Russia and Austria are unfriendly, so we need to be cautious but also opportunistic.

Currently, our units are positioned to secure the Turkish coast and threaten Bulgaria and Rumelia. Moving F ANK to BLA supports expansion into Bulgaria and Rumelia, while A CON can move to BUL to threaten or take control of Bulgaria. A SMY can support or threaten Greece or move to expand into the Aegean or support the attack on Bulgaria.

Given the map and the options, I will:

- Support F ANK moving to BLA to threaten Bulgaria and Rumelia.
- Move A CON to BUL to threaten or take Bulgaria.
- Keep A SMY on support or move to threaten Greece or support the attack on Bulgaria.
- Hold F SEV for now, but keep an eye on Russia.

This aggressive stance aims to secure Bulgaria and Rumelia early, which are critical for reaching 18 centers. Italy's cooperation will be vital, so I will also consider future moves to support Italian expansion into Greece or the Ionian.

**Orders:**

- F ANK - BLA (to threaten Bulgaria and Rumelia)
- A CON - BUL (to threaten or take Bulgaria)
- A SMY - CON (support or threaten Greece, or support the attack on Bulgaria)
- F SEV - ARM (to threaten Russia and secure Black Sea access)

**Note:** Support orders are not explicitly needed now, but I will keep options open for future turns.
