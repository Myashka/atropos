atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

gpt-4o,RUSSIA,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for RUSSIA in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is RUSSIA. The S1901M phase. 
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Goals:**
  1. **North Sea Control:** The North Sea is a critical area for England, providing access to multiple territories and supply centers. Securing it early ensures naval superiority and strategic flexibility.
  2. **Capture Neutral Centers:** Norway and Belgium are key targets for early expansion. They are relatively accessible and provide additional supply centers to bolster England's position.
  3. **Alliance Formation:** Forming a strong alliance with either France or Germany can help secure England's western front, allowing focus on other areas for expansion. This decision should be based on early diplomatic interactions and perceived threats.

- **Initial Relationships:**
  - All relationships are marked as ""Neutral"" at the start, reflecting the lack of initial commitments or hostilities. This neutrality allows for flexibility in forming alliances or identifying threats based on early diplomatic exchanges.",Success: Applied LLM data
