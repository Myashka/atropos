atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

EXAMPLES:

Scenario 1: As France, after discussing a joint move against Germany with England, while Italy seems to be posturing aggressively in Piedmont.

{""negotiation_summary"": ""Reached a tentative agreement with England to support their fleet into Belgium (BEL) if they support my army into Ruhr (RUH). Italy's messages are vague but their army in Piedmont (PIE) is concerning; they claim it's defensive against Austria but it also threatens Marseilles (MAR). Russia remains silent. Austria and Turkey are focused on each other."",""intent"": ""Secure Ruhr with English support. Hold Marseilles defensively. Probe Italy's intentions further. If England upholds their end, improve relations. If Italy moves on MAR, downgrade relations severely."",""updated_relationships"": {
""ENGLAND"": ""Friendly"",
""GERMANY"": ""Enemy"",
""ITALY"": ""Unfriendly"",
""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",
""RUSSIA"": ""Neutral"",
""TURKEY"": ""Neutral""
}

Analyze the negotiations, goals, relationships, and game state to:
1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements
2. State your strategic intent for S1901M
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Note which powers are not responding to your messages and consider adjusting your approach

When powers ignore your messages, consider:
- They may be intentionally avoiding commitment
- They could be prioritizing other relationships
- Your approach may need adjustment (more direct questions, different incentives)
- Their silence might indicate hostility or indifference

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna

    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure the North Sea and the English Channel to establish naval dominance, while also capturing Belgium early to increase my supply centers and strengthen my position against Germany.
- I will move my fleet from Edinburgh (EDI) to the North Sea (NTH) to position myself for future moves towards Belgium and to support any potential actions in the English Channel.
- The fleet in London (LON) will also move to the North Sea (NTH) to consolidate my naval presence and provide support for future operations.
- The army in Liverpool (LVP) will move to Yorkshire (YOR), which will allow me to potentially support a future move to Belgium or defend against any German incursions.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure control of Rumania (RUM) and Serbia (SER) to expand my influence in the Balkans. Both of these centers are crucial for my early expansion.
- I will move my army from Budapest (BUD) to Rumania (RUM) to take control of it, as it is currently unoccupied. This move is aggressive and aligns with my goal of proactive expansion.
- I will also move my army from Vienna (VIE) to Serbia (SER) to secure that center as well. This will allow me to control both Rumania and Serbia in this turn, significantly strengthening my position.
- My fleet in Trieste (TRI) will hold, as it is currently in a good position to support future moves or defend against any potential threats from Italy or the Adriatic Sea.

gpt-4o-mini,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is ITALY. The S1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.
Use the information below to inform your approach.


Power: ITALY
Phase: S1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure control of the Adriatic Sea and Venice to threaten Austria and gain access to the Balkans.
- Form a temporary alliance with France to counterbalance Austria and Germany while expanding into the Mediterranean.
- Establish a foothold in the Eastern Mediterranean by targeting Turkey's supply centers.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Enemy
- ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Friendly
- GERMANY: Unfriendly
- RUSSIA: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. France remains friendly and responsive, while Austria is viewed as an enemy. Other powers have not engaged in meaningful discussions. Italy's position in Venice is stable, but there is a need to secure the Adriatic Sea to threaten Austria and gain access to the Balkans.

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] All powers have been responsive, but no significant agreements or commitments have been reached. Russia remains unfriendly, likely due to competing interests in the Black Sea. Austria and Italy are friendly, which could be beneficial for Balkan expansion. No powers are ignoring messages, indicating open lines of communication.

   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Turkey, my primary objectives in the Spring 1901 move phase are to secure the Black Sea and begin expanding into the Balkans. Given the unfriendly stance of Russia, securing the Black Sea is crucial to prevent Russian naval dominance and to protect my southern flank. Additionally, moving towards Bulgaria is a strategic step to gain a foothold in the Balkans and potentially expand further into Greece or Serbia.

1. **F ANK - BLA**: Moving the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea is a critical move to contest Russian control and establish naval dominance. This move is aggressive and aims to prevent Russia from using the Black Sea as a launch point for attacks against Turkey.

2. **A CON - BUL**: Moving the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria is a proactive expansion move. Bulgaria is a neutral supply center and capturing it will strengthen Turkey's position in the Balkans.

3. **A SMY - CON**: Moving the army from Smyrna to Constantinople is a strategic repositioning. This move allows flexibility for future turns, enabling the army to support operations in the Balkans or defend against potential threats.

These moves align with the strategic principles of proactive expansion and calculated aggression, while also setting the stage for dynamic alliances with Austria and Italy, who are currently friendly.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Russia, my primary goal in Spring 1901 is to secure early supply centers and establish a strong position in both the north and south. Given the current relationships and strategic objectives, I will focus on the following:

1. **Northern Strategy:**
   - Move the fleet in St. Petersburg (F STP/SC) to the Gulf of Bothnia (GOB) to position for a potential move into Sweden in the fall. This move also allows flexibility to support actions in the Baltic Sea region.
   - Move the army in Moscow (A MOS) to Ukraine (UKR) to support southern operations and potentially threaten Rumania or Galicia.

2. **Southern Strategy:**
   - Move the fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV) to the Black Sea (BLA) to contest Turkish control and potentially support a move into Rumania or Bulgaria.
   - Move the army in Warsaw (A WAR) to Galicia (GAL) to pressure Austria and potentially support a move into Rumania or defend against Austrian aggression.

These moves aim to secure key positions for future expansion while maintaining flexibility to adapt to the actions of other powers.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with Austria stunning the crowd—vaulting from Budapest into Rumania while its “ally” Russia surges armies into both Ukraine and Galicia, turning the Balkans into a powder keg. Turkey answers by yanking Smyrna’s troops up to Constantinople and snatching Bulgaria, so the tri-corner clash around the Black Sea is set to ignite after the Sev–Ank fleet bounce. Up north, England’s double-barreled charge at the North Sea is stonewalled, letting Germany steal an uncontested Denmark and tighten its grip on the center while a cagey France keeps every piece on guard. And don’t miss Italy’s perfectly choreographed three-unit pile-up into Apulia—a clear signal that the green pieces are about to dive eastward—so buckle up, fans, the Balkan bloodbath is only a phase away!

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with Austria stunning the crowd—vaulting from Budapest into Rumania while its “ally” Russia surges armies into both Ukraine and Galicia, turning the Balkans into a powder keg. Turkey answers by yanking Smyrna’s troops up to Constantinople and snatching Bulgaria, so the tri-corner clash around the Black Sea is set to ignite after the Sev–Ank fleet bounce. Up north, England’s double-barreled charge at the North Sea is stonewalled, letting Germany steal an uncontested Denmark and tighten its grip on the center while a cagey France keeps every piece on guard. And don’t miss Italy’s perfectly choreographed three-unit pile-up into Apulia—a clear signal that the green pieces are about to dive eastward—so buckle up, fans, the Balkan bloodbath is only a phase away!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure control of the North Sea and the English Channel to facilitate naval dominance.
- Establish a strong alliance with France to counterbalance Germany and Russia while focusing on expansion in the west.
- Aim to capture Belgium early to increase supply centers and strengthen position against Germany.

PHASE SUMMARY (S1901M):
Spring 1901 detonates with Austria stunning the crowd—vaulting from Budapest into Rumania while its “ally” Russia surges armies into both Ukraine and Galicia, turning the Balkans into a powder keg. Turkey answers by yanking Smyrna’s troops up to Constantinople and snatching Bulgaria, so the tri-corner clash around the Black Sea is set to ignite after the Sev–Ank fleet bounce. Up north, England’s double-barreled charge at the North Sea is stonewalled, letting Germany steal an uncontested Denmark and tighten its grip on the center while a cagey France keeps every piece on guard. And don’t miss Italy’s perfectly choreographed three-unit pile-up into Apulia—a clear signal that the green pieces are about to dive eastward—so buckle up, fans, the Balkan bloodbath is only a phase away!

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure early supply centers in the north by moving towards Sweden and Norway.
- Establish a strong presence in the south by securing Rumania and potentially moving into the Black Sea.
- Form strategic alliances to manage threats from neighboring powers, particularly Germany and Turkey.

Relationships with other powers (['AUSTRIA', 'ENGLAND', 'FRANCE', 'GERMANY', 'ITALY', 'TURKEY']):

2. Use ONLY these relationship values: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally
3. Make goals specific and actionable
4. Base analysis on actual events, not assumptions
5. Return ONLY valid JSON - no text before or after

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

You are playing the board game Diplomacy. Your power is AUSTRIA. The F1901M phase.
Your primary goal is to control 18 supply centers.

Power: AUSTRIA
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure control of Rumania and Serbia to strengthen position in the Balkans.
- Negotiate a strong alliance with Italy to counteract potential threats from Germany and Russia.
- Maintain a defensive posture against Germany while seeking opportunities to gain Munich.
Relationships: - ENGLAND: Neutral
- FRANCE: Neutral
- GERMANY: Unfriendly
- ITALY: Friendly
- RUSSIA: Unfriendly
- TURKEY: Unfriendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. All powers have been responsive, but no concrete alliances or plans have been established. Italy remains friendly, which is promising for future collaboration. Germany and Russia are unfriendly, indicating potential threats. England and France are neutral, with no immediate concerns from them.

[S1901M] Austria is moving its army from Budapest to Rumania to secure the center, while the fleet in Trieste is holding position for defense. Additionally, the army in Vienna is supporting the move to Munich, aiming to strengthen influence in the region and potentially gain control of Germany's supply center.

[F1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. Austria is focused on securing Rumania and Serbia while maintaining a friendly relationship with Italy. Germany remains unfriendly, and Russia is also unfriendly. England and France have not engaged in negotiations with Austria. Italy has shown friendliness, which could be beneficial for future cooperation against Germany and Russia.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

Power: ENGLAND
Phase: F1901M

PLAYER STATUS
Current Goals: - Secure control of the North Sea and the English Channel.
- Capture Belgium to increase supply centers and strengthen position against Germany.
- Maintain a strong alliance with France to counterbalance Germany's influence.
Relationships: - AUSTRIA: Neutral
- FRANCE: Friendly

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] All powers have been responsive, but no significant agreements have been reached. France appears friendly and may support my ambitions in the west, while Germany remains unfriendly. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Turkey are neutral, with no direct engagements. My focus is on securing the North Sea and the English Channel, and capturing Belgium early to strengthen my position against Germany.

[S1901M] Moved fleets from Edinburgh and London to the North Sea, and advanced the army from Liverpool to Yorkshire. This positions England for naval dominance in the North Sea and aims to secure Belgium early, while fostering a friendly relationship with France to counter Germany.

[F1901M] All powers have been responsive, but no significant agreements have been reached. France remains friendly and supportive of England's goals, while Germany is unfriendly and poses a potential threat. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Turkey are neutral, with no notable interactions. England's focus is on securing the North Sea and the English Channel, as well as capturing Belgium.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure the North Sea and the English Channel while also capturing Belgium early to increase my supply centers and strengthen my position against Germany.
- I will move my fleet from Edinburgh (EDI) to the North Sea (NTH) to establish naval dominance and support future moves towards Belgium.
- The fleet in London (LON) will also move to the North Sea (NTH) to reinforce my naval presence and provide support for the army in Yorkshire (YOR) as it moves towards Belgium.
- The army in Yorkshire (YOR) will move to Liverpool (LVP) to position itself for a future attack on Belgium, while also being supported by the fleet in London (LON).
- This strategy allows me to maintain a strong alliance with France while countering Germany's influence.

gpt-4o-mini,ITALY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure the Adriatic Sea and threaten Austria's position by moving my fleet from Apulia (APU) to the Adriatic Sea (ADR). This will allow me to control the Adriatic and put pressure on Austria's Trieste (TRI).
- I will also support my army in Venice (VEN) to hold its position, ensuring that I maintain control over this supply center while preparing for future moves against Austria.
- The army in Rome (ROM) will support the fleet in Apulia (APU) to ensure a successful move to the Adriatic Sea.
- This strategy aligns with my goal of proactive expansion and calculated aggression against Austria, while also maintaining a friendly relationship with France.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France
    - Brest

    - Sevastopol
    - Warsaw
  Turkey
    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Belgium (BEL) and Denmark (DEN) to increase my supply centers early in the game.
- I have already ordered my fleet in Kiel (F KIE) to move to Denmark (DEN) and my army in Berlin (A BER) to move to Munich (MUN), while the army in Munich (A MUN) will hold to protect my home center.
- To secure Belgium, I will move my fleet from Denmark (F DEN) to the North Sea (NTH) to position myself for a future move towards Belgium, while also keeping options open for potential support from England or France.
- I will also consider the possibility of supporting my move to Belgium with my army in Munich (A MUN) if I can establish a relationship with either England or France.

gpt-4o,RUSSIA,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as RUSSIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] All powers have been responsive, but no significant agreements have been reached yet. The focus remains on securing early supply centers in the north and south. England appears friendly, which could be beneficial for northern expansion. Turkey is unfriendly, indicating potential conflict in the south.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move Army Moscow to Ukraine and Army Warsaw to Galicia to position for potential expansion into Rumania and influence in Austria. Fleet Sevastopol moves to the Black Sea to challenge Turkey's presence. Fleet St. Petersburg holds to maintain a defensive posture in the north. The strategic intent is to secure early supply centers and establish a strong southern presence while maintaining a defensive stance in the north.

[F1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. All powers have been responsive, but Austria and Turkey remain unfriendly. England is friendly, and Germany's intentions are unclear. Focus remains on securing Rumania and Sweden while monitoring Germany's actions.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{

    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

1. **Objective:** Secure Rumania and Sweden to strengthen Russia's position by gaining additional supply centers. This will help in building a stronger military presence in future turns.

2. **Southern Strategy:**
   - **A UKR - RUM:** Move the Army in Ukraine to Rumania to capture this neutral supply center. This move is crucial for expanding Russian influence in the Balkans.
   - **A GAL S A UKR - RUM:** Support the move from Ukraine to Rumania with the Army in Galicia. This ensures that the move to Rumania is successful, especially given the presence of Austrian forces in Rumania.
   - **F SEV - BLA:** Move the Fleet in Sevastopol to the Black Sea. This move is aggressive towards Turkey and aims to establish naval dominance in the region, which is critical given Turkey's unfriendly stance.

3. **Northern Strategy:**
   - **F STP/SC H:** Hold the Fleet in St. Petersburg (South Coast) to maintain a defensive posture in the north. This fleet can later be used to move towards Sweden or defend against any potential threats from the north.

These moves are designed to secure key supply centers while maintaining a defensive posture in the north. The support from Galicia ensures a higher chance of success in capturing Rumania, while the move to the Black Sea positions Russia to counter Turkish aggression.

gpt-4o,TURKEY,F1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] All powers have been responsive, but no significant agreements or commitments have been reached. Russia remains unfriendly, likely due to competing interests in the Black Sea. Austria and Italy are friendly, which could be beneficial for Balkan expansion. No powers are ignoring messages, indicating open lines of communication.

[S1901M] Issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea to secure naval dominance and protect against Russia. Advanced the army from Constantinople to Bulgaria to expand into the Balkans. Moved the army from Smyrna to Constantinople to strengthen our position and prepare for further expansion.

[F1901M] All powers have been responsive, but no significant agreements or commitments have been reached. The focus remains on securing Bulgaria and preparing for potential conflict with Russia. Austria and Italy are open to collaboration against Russia, but no concrete plans have been established. Monitoring Italy's movements is crucial to ensure they do not threaten Turkish interests in the Balkans.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Turkey, my primary objectives for this phase are to secure Bulgaria, gain control of the Black Sea, and prepare for potential conflict with Russia. Given the current unit positions and the strategic importance of the Black Sea, I will focus on the following:

1. **Fleet in Ankara (F ANK):** The most critical move is to attempt to gain control of the Black Sea. This will provide a strategic advantage against Russia and secure a naval position that can support future operations in the region. Therefore, I will move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea.

2. **Army in Bulgaria (A BUL):** Bulgaria is a key supply center that I need to secure. I will hold the army in Bulgaria to ensure control over this territory and prevent any potential incursions from neighboring powers.

3. **Army in Constantinople (A CON):** To maintain flexibility and prepare for future moves, I will move the army from Constantinople to Smyrna. This will allow me to potentially build a fleet in Smyrna in the future, enhancing my naval capabilities.

PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
The Tsar roars out of Ukraine, Galicia cheering him on, as Russia rips Rumania from Austria and plants a fifth flag while the Black Sea explodes in another Sev-vs-Ank stalemate.  Austria scrambles out of the wreckage, pivoting the ousted Rumanian army into freshly claimed Serbia to stay level and block Germany’s probing bayonets.  Up north, the North Sea becomes a demolition derby—England’s twin fleets and Germany’s Danish squadron smash into a three-way bounce, leaving both captains fuming and ports clogged.  With Italy quietly sliding a new fleet into the Adriatic and Turkey shifting the capital to Smyrna, the whole board is primed for an even bloodier 1902.

Board State:


PHASE SUMMARY (F1901M):
The Tsar roars out of Ukraine, Galicia cheering him on, as Russia rips Rumania from Austria and plants a fifth flag while the Black Sea explodes in another Sev-vs-Ank stalemate.  Austria scrambles out of the wreckage, pivoting the ousted Rumanian army into freshly claimed Serbia to stay level and block Germany’s probing bayonets.  Up north, the North Sea becomes a demolition derby—England’s twin fleets and Germany’s Danish squadron smash into a three-way bounce, leaving both captains fuming and ports clogged.  With Italy quietly sliding a new fleet into the Adriatic and Turkey shifting the capital to Smyrna, the whole board is primed for an even bloodier 1902.

CURRENT STATUS
Goals:
- Secure Belgium to increase supply centers.
- Establish a diplomatic relationship with either England or France to counterbalance threats from Austria and Russia.

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RECENT PRIVATE DIARY ENTRIES (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. All powers have been responsive, but no concrete alliances or plans have been established. Italy remains friendly, which is promising for future collaboration. Germany and Russia are unfriendly, indicating potential threats. England and France are neutral, with no immediate concerns from them.

[S1901M] Austria is moving its army from Budapest to Rumania to secure the center, while the fleet in Trieste is holding position for defense. Additionally, the army in Vienna is supporting the move to Munich, aiming to strengthen influence in the region and potentially gain control of Germany's supply center.

[F1901M] No significant agreements reached this round. Austria is focused on securing Rumania and Serbia while maintaining a friendly relationship with Italy. Germany remains unfriendly, and Russia is also unfriendly. England and France have not engaged in negotiations with Austria. Italy has shown friendliness, which could be beneficial for future cooperation against Germany and Russia.

[F1901M] Austria is advancing into Serbia with the army from Rumania, while the fleet in Trieste is holding position. The army in Vienna is supporting the move to Munich, aiming to secure a strong foothold in the region and strengthen alliances, particularly with Italy.

gpt-4o-mini,GERMANY,W1901A,order_generation,"You are playing as GERMANY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

In the Winter 1901 Adjustment phase, my primary focus is on reinforcing my position and preparing for future expansion. I have successfully secured Rumania, which is a critical supply center in the south. My relationship with Turkey remains tense, so I need to be cautious about potential conflicts in the Black Sea. In the north, I aim to secure Sweden, which will require careful diplomacy with England and Germany. Given the current state, I have the opportunity to build additional units to strengthen my position.

**Build Strategy:**

1. **Army in Moscow (MOS):** This will allow me to reinforce my position in the south or pivot towards the north if needed. It provides flexibility to respond to threats or opportunities in either direction.

2. **Fleet in St. Petersburg (STP/SC):** Building a fleet here will help me project power in the north, particularly towards Sweden and potentially Norway. It also serves as a deterrent against any aggressive moves from England or Germany.

3. **Fleet in Sevastopol (SEV):** This will bolster my naval presence in the Black Sea, providing a stronger position against Turkey and securing my southern flank.

[F1901M] Issued orders to move the fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea to challenge Russian naval presence, hold position in Bulgaria to secure it, and move the army from Constantinople to Smyrna to consolidate control over Turkish territories. The strategic intent is to prepare for potential conflict with Russia while maintaining friendly relations with Austria and Italy.

}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",

  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Turkey, my primary focus is on securing and expanding my position in the Balkans and the Black Sea. Given the current situation, my goals are to solidify control over Bulgaria, attempt to gain control of the Black Sea, and prepare for potential conflicts with Russia. I also need to maintain friendly relations with Austria and Italy to form a coalition against Russian expansion.

1. **Fleet in Ankara (F ANK):** The fleet in Ankara should move to the Black Sea to challenge Russian naval presence. This move is crucial to counter Russian influence and secure a strategic position for future operations.

2. **Army in Bulgaria (A BUL):** The army in Bulgaria should hold its position to ensure control over this vital supply center. Holding Bulgaria is essential to maintain a strong foothold in the Balkans.

3. **Army in Smyrna (A SMY):** The army in Smyrna should move to Constantinople. This move will consolidate control over Turkish territories and prepare for potential future operations, either defensive or offensive.

These moves align with my strategic objectives of securing the Black Sea, holding Bulgaria, and preparing for potential conflicts with Russia while maintaining flexibility for future actions.

PHASE SUMMARY (W1901A):
Winter 1901 slams shut with Russia flexing a five-center lead and stamping a brand-new army in Moscow, announcing itself as the early titan. Germany roars back by launching a fresh fleet from Kiel while Turkey mirrors the splash in Constantinople, lighting the fuse on an East–West naval arms race. Austria, oddly pocketing an unused build despite its four centers, now looks exposed just as tensions spike in the Balkans. The stage is set for a seething Spring 1902, with Russia in pole position and steel keels everywhere itching for first blood!

}

4. As England, after a failed attack on Belgium (BEL) which was occupied by France, supported by Germany. Russia moved into Sweden (SWE) uncontested. Austria and Italy skirmished over Trieste (TRI). Turkey was quiet.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""My attack on Belgium was decisively repulsed due to Franco-German cooperation, marking them as a significant threat bloc. Russia's acquisition of Sweden is concerning for my northern position. The Austro-Italian conflict seems localized for now, and Turkey's inactivity makes them an unknown variable, potentially open to diplomacy."",
  ""relationships"": {
    ""FRANCE"": ""Enemy"",
    ""GERMANY"": ""Enemy"",
    ""RUSSIA"": ""Unfriendly"",
    ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",

}

5. As Russia, after successfully negotiating passage through Black Sea (BLA) with Turkey to take Rumania (RUM). Germany moved into Silesia (SIL), threatening Warsaw (WAR). Austria and France exchanged hostile messages but made no direct moves against each other. England built a new fleet in London (LON). Italy seems focused west.

{
  ""reasoning"": ""Securing Rumania via Turkish agreement is a major success. This improves my southern position and Turkey is now a provisional ally. Germany's move into Silesia is a direct and immediate threat to Warsaw; they are now my primary adversary. Austria and France are posturing, but their conflict doesn't directly affect me yet, keeping them neutral. England's new fleet is a long-term concern but not immediate. Italy's westward focus means they are not a current threat or priority."",
  ""relationships"": {
    ""GERMANY"": ""Enemy"",
    ""AUSTRIA"": ""Neutral"",
    ""TURKEY"": ""Ally"",
    ""ITALY"": ""Neutral"",
    ""FRANCE"": ""Neutral"",

    ""Defend Warsaw against Germany, possibly by moving Lvn-War or Mos-War."",
