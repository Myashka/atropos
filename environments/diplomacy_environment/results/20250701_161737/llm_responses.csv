atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,initial_state_setup,"You are the agent for FRANCE in a game of Diplomacy at the very start (Spring 1901). Analyze the initial board position and suggest 2-3 strategic high-level goals for the early game. Consider your power's strengths, weaknesses, and neighbors. Also, provide an initial assessment of relationships with other powers. IMPORTANT: For each relationship, you MUST use exactly one of the following labels: Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally. Format your response as a JSON object with two keys: 'initial_goals' (a list of strings) and 'initial_relationships' (a dictionary mapping power names to one of the allowed relationship strings).

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Goals:**
  1. **Secure control of Norway and Belgium:** These are key neutral supply centers that are relatively accessible to England. Securing them early can provide a strong foundation for further expansion.
  2. **Establish a strong naval presence:** Controlling the North Sea and English Channel is crucial for England to defend its home centers and project power into mainland Europe.
  3. **Form strategic alliances:** Depending on the diplomatic landscape, aligning with either France or Germany can help secure England's position and allow for focused expansion efforts.

- **Initial Relationships:**
  - All relationships are marked as ""Neutral"" at the start, as no specific alliances or hostilities have been established yet. This neutrality allows for flexibility in forming alliances or identifying threats based on the evolving diplomatic interactions.",Success: Applied LLM data

atropos-training-policy,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as France in a game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London
  France

    - Ankara
    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

    - Budapest
    - Trieste
    - Vienna
  England
    - Edinburgh
    - Liverpool
    - London

    - Constantinople
    - Smyrna

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) as they are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- The fleet in Kiel (KIE) is well-positioned to move to Denmark, while the army in Munich (MUN) can move to Holland.
- I will hold my units in Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) to ensure they are secure against potential threats from France or Russia.
- I will also consider the potential for a future alliance with Austria, so maintaining a friendly stance is important, but I need to be aggressive in my expansion.

gpt-4o-mini,TURKEY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as TURKEY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.
- Formulate plans and issue orders that align with your goals.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

gpt-4o,ITALY,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ITALY in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Italy in Spring 1901, my primary goal is to secure Tunis, a neutral supply center, to strengthen my position in the Mediterranean. This aligns with my strategic principle of proactive expansion. Additionally, I aim to maintain a strong diplomatic relationship with Austria, as they are currently friendly and open to cooperation in the Balkans. This will help ensure stability in the region and potentially allow for future collaboration against Turkey or Russia.

Given the current diplomatic landscape, I will focus on the following moves:

1. **Fleet in Naples (F NAP) to Ionian Sea (ION):** This move positions my fleet to capture Tunis in the following turn, securing a crucial supply center in the Mediterranean.

2. **Army in Rome (A ROM) to Apulia (APU):** This move positions my army to support future operations in the Balkans or southern France, depending on how diplomatic relations evolve.

3. **Army in Venice (A VEN) holds:** Holding in Venice ensures that I maintain a defensive posture against any potential aggression from Austria or France, while also keeping my options open for future moves.

These moves are designed to secure my immediate objectives while maintaining flexibility for future strategic decisions.

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As Russia in Spring 1901, my primary objectives are to secure neutral supply centers and establish a strong position in both the north and south. Specifically, I aim to secure Sweden and Rumania, while also ensuring a presence in the Black Sea to counter potential Turkish aggression.

1. **Fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV):** Moving to the Black Sea (BLA) is crucial to establish a presence and counter Turkey's potential moves. This move also positions me to support future operations in the Balkans.

2. **Army in Moscow (A MOS):** Moving to Ukraine (UKR) positions this army to support a move into Rumania in the fall, while also providing flexibility to respond to any developments in the south.

3. **Army in Warsaw (A WAR):** Moving to Galicia (GAL) serves multiple purposes: it pressures Austria, potentially deterring them from aggressive moves, and positions me to support operations in the Balkans.

4. **Fleet in St. Petersburg (F STP/SC):** Moving to the Gulf of Bothnia (BOT) sets up a future move into Sweden, aligning with my agreement with England to focus on Sweden while they target Norway.

These moves are aggressive yet calculated, aiming to secure key positions and supply centers while maintaining flexibility to adapt to the evolving diplomatic landscape.

gpt-4o,ENGLAND,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as ENGLAND in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","**Reasoning:**

As England, my primary goal in the early game is to secure additional supply centers and establish a strong naval presence. Given the current diplomatic landscape and my strategic objectives, I will focus on the following:

1. **Securing Norway:** This is a critical supply center for England and will help establish a foothold in Scandinavia. Moving the fleet from Edinburgh to the Norwegian Sea (NWG) positions me to take Norway in the fall.

2. **Establishing Naval Dominance:** Moving the fleet from London to the North Sea (NTH) is crucial for controlling access to the British Isles and for future operations in Scandinavia and the Low Countries.

3. **Positioning for Belgium:** While I aim to secure Belgium, I must be cautious of potential French aggression. Moving the army from Liverpool to Yorkshire (YOR) positions it for a convoy to Belgium in the fall, if the opportunity arises.

4. **Diplomatic Considerations:** I will maintain open communication with Germany to ensure mutual understanding in the North Sea and explore potential cooperation with Russia regarding Scandinavia.

**Orders:**

- Move the fleet from Edinburgh to the Norwegian Sea to position for Norway.
- Move the fleet from London to the North Sea to establish naval control.
- Move the army from Liverpool to Yorkshire to prepare for potential convoy operations.

gpt-4o-mini,AUSTRIA,S1901M,order_generation,"You are playing as AUSTRIA in the game of Diplomacy.

Your Goal: Achieve world domination by controlling 18 supply centers.

**General Strategic Principles for Victory:**

*   **Proactive Expansion:** Diplomacy is a game of conquest. Prioritize securing new supply centers, especially in the early game. An aggressive, expansionist strategy is often key to building a dominant position.
*   **Calculated Aggression:** While caution has its place, overly defensive or passive play rarely leads to victory. Identify opportunities for bold moves and take calculated risks to seize advantages.
*   **Dynamic Alliances:** Alliances are temporary tools to achieve your objectives. Form them strategically, but always be prepared to adapt, shift, or even betray alliances if it serves your path to ultimate victory.
*   **Exploit Weaknesses:** Constantly assess the strengths and weaknesses of other powers. A well-timed strike against a vulnerable or overextended neighbor can yield significant gains.
*   **Focus on Winning:** The ultimate goal is to control 18 supply centers. Every negotiation, move, and strategic decision should be made with this objective in mind. Aim for outright victory, not just survival or a stalemate.
*   **Adapt and Overcome:** Be flexible in your strategy. The political landscape will change rapidly. Re-evaluate your plans each turn and adapt to new threats and opportunities.

General Instructions:
- Analyze the game state carefully each phase.
- Communicate clearly and strategically with other powers.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A PAR H"",
    ""A MAR - BUR"",
    ""F BRE - MAO""
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A BER H"",
    ""A MUN H"",
    ""F KIE - DEN"",
    ""A RUH - HOL"",
    ""A SIL - WAR"", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    ""F HEL H""      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [
    ""A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A APU S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""F ION S A VEN - TRI"",
    ""A ROM H"",
    ""F NAP - TYS""
  ]
}}

RESPOND WITH YOUR REASONING AND ORDERS (within PARSABLE OUTPUT) BELOW","Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to secure Rumania and Serbia as they are crucial for expanding my influence in the Balkans.
- I will move my army from Budapest (BUD) to Rumania (RUM) to take control of that supply center. This move is aggressive and aligns with my objective of proactive expansion.
- I will also move my army from Vienna (VIE) to Serbia (SER) to secure that territory as well. This will further solidify my position in the Balkans and provide a buffer against potential threats from Germany or Russia.
- My fleet in Trieste (TRI) will hold its position to maintain control of the Adriatic Sea and support my land operations if needed. It is important to keep this fleet in a defensive posture while I focus on land expansion.
